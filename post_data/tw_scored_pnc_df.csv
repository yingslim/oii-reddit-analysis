Taiwanese dating culture/ pitfalls to avoid?,1gl07yl,"I met this Taiwanese lady at the gym and I've been really enjoying the conversations I've had with her. Asked for her number and we've been texting back and forth a bit. I've driven her home after the class a couple times* and we've made plans to go out on Friday night. 

I am terrible at reading people, so I'm not sure if this means she's reciprocating romantic interest or just being friendly. Given the cultural and language barrier and my general awkwardness (her English is pretty good but she misses stuff sometimes) I'm not necessarily sure that she's even *aware* that I'm attempting to show that I'm interested in her.

I've thought about just being direct about it - if the vibes are good at the end of the night Friday just telling her that I like her and I'd like to take her out again explicitly as a date,  but I don't want to make her uncomfortable or unknowingly commit some sort of huge faux pas.

Anyways,  I'd really appreciate any advice or insights you had to offer. 



*I was driving a borrowed pickup truck the one night and apparently she'd never ridden in one before - she was *so* excited and it was probably the most adorable thing I've ever seen. ",1730904595.0,31,HobieSailor,onwiyuu,HobieSailor,1730905068.0,160,CULTURAL

Taiwanese dating culture/ pitfalls to avoid?,1gl07yl,"I met this Taiwanese lady at the gym and I've been really enjoying the conversations I've had with her. Asked for her number and we've been texting back and forth a bit. I've driven her home after the class a couple times* and we've made plans to go out on Friday night. 

I am terrible at reading people, so I'm not sure if this means she's reciprocating romantic interest or just being friendly. Given the cultural and language barrier and my general awkwardness (her English is pretty good but she misses stuff sometimes) I'm not necessarily sure that she's even *aware* that I'm attempting to show that I'm interested in her.

My experience going through obtaining a driver's license in Taiwan,1gktary,"I didn't have a driver's license before Taiwan so I applied and got it here. The instructor basically told and showed me a few basic skills (parking, starting the car, turning etc), then I was on my own for the whole thing. I just went there and practiced these couple skills. There was also an online class for theoretical exam but it was in Chinese and I was told it was just basic information about driving anyway. I wasn't taught anything other than basic skills. And when the practical exam day came, the examiner kept rushing me to make it to the green lights because he didn't want to waste time waiting for the red lights. Overall, I feel like I have learned next to nothing during the whole thing.

Also, we are looking for studios for wedding photoshoots. Any suggestion or recommendation will be greatly appreciated. TIA",1730877141.0,0,lilv2025,lilv2025,lilv2025,1730966420.0,1,CULTURAL

Working APRC question,1gk34nq,"Hi everyone.

I am a foreigner who stayed in Taïwan for around 7 years and half and worked for the last 6 years here.

I'm considering applying for the APRC but I have an issue.

For now I'm working but I would like to take a year off to focus on my recent health issues and learn Chinese full time for at least a year. This means I would probably quit my current position during the next month.

As I worked 5 years and fulfill all the requirements I will go to the immigration agency this week. But will leaving my job the next month prevent me from having my APRC ?

Basically, if you worked 5 years in Taïwan and quited your job recently OR if you are in the notice period,  can you still apply for the working APRC ( the one that requires 5 years or working in Taïwan ) ?
Also, if you submitted your application for the APRC and quit before you officially receive it, does that cancel the process ?

Thanks in advance !",1730800097.0,1,Virthuss,hyrate,Virthuss,1730807859.0,1,OTHER

Can my friend from Hong Kong ship parcels to Taiwan FamilyMart,1gk2riq,"My friend from Hong Kong wants to send me a parcel to Taiwan. But due to personal reasons, I don’t want to send him my home address, and I thought about telling him to ship the parcel to FamilyMart and I’ll pick it up. Will that work? He will be using Hongkong Post Service, not DHL, FedEx, or any of those shipping companies.

So I just want to clarify if he can use Hongkong Post Service to deliver the parcel to Taiwan FamilyMart. Then once the parcel arrives at FamilyMart, they will call me and I’ll go pick it up.

I already sent him the FamilyMart address I want him to send to. He'll write the FamilyMart address on the parcel along with my phone number.",1730798383.0,1,InternationalAir6424,lucywithsomethc,InternationalAir6424,1730809838.0,1,OTHER
"Lost My Item in a Taxi… Or So I Thought, Until I Caught the Driver Swiping It",1gj412s,"Still in disbelief this is actually happened.

So yesterday (Sunday), a friend of mine (Taiwanese) is supposed to pick up a cake from a local pastry shop in Taipei.

Initially, the plan is for me to drive there, but since it’s Sunday and traffic is everywhere, I really don’t want to deal with finding a car parking spot later again (I found a sweet spot and just wanted to keep it), so we decide to take a taxi instead.

Uber has at least 10min wait time, and we see 2-3 taxis pass by already, so we just wave, and one minute later we’re inside a yellow car, heading toward our destination.

The plan is to get to the store, pick up the cake, and then take the same taxi back home.

We arrive near the cake place and ask the taxi driver if he can wait for us for two minutes since we’ll be back soon.

Now here’s where it gets interesting: we return to the taxi, and as I get in the backseat, the first thing I notice is that my power bank, which I’ve left right here on the backseat, is gone.

I’m very sure I left the power bank on the backseat (I didn’t take it with me to the cake store), so I start looking around for it. Finally I say to my friend, “This is strange, but I had my power bank right here on the seat, and now it’s gone.”

As we head back, we ask the taxi driver multiple times if he’s seen our power bank or if anyone else might have entered the taxi and taken it, but he denies it.

This really puzzles me since I’m certain I left the power bank on the back seat so no one else except the taxi driver could have moved it.

This is a high-end power bank that’s been useful on countless occasions, so I don’t want to just let it go.

We tell the taxi driver that once we arrive, we want to search the car.

We stop on a different street near our destination (I don’t want the taxi driver to know exactly where we’re going), pay the fare, and start looking around.

After a few minutes of searching (including the front glovebox), we’re running out of options—but I know the power bank is somewhere in this car.

I’m tired at this point and just want to end this and get on with the rest of my evening.

So I get out of the car, open the driver’s door, and politely ask him to stand up and get out of the car.

He says he won’t stand up and insists that this is all ridiculous and he doesn’t have time for it.

His reaction makes me feel more suspicious, as it shouldn’t be a big deal for him to stand up and help us search for the lost item.

I look around his seat while he’s sitting there, and then I spot a shiny USB cable coming out from literally beneath him.

I reach out (screw his personal space at this point), grab the cable, and pull the power bank from under his ass.

What. The. Fuck.

So he’s taken it from the back seat while we were away, hid it under his ass, and has been sitting on it the whole time while we search for it like dummies 😭😭

Speechless, I give him that “what the fuck, dude” look and shut the door. 

I am tired, I just want to go home.

The moment I shut the door, he quickly drives off, so I don’t have enough time to snap a photo of his car plate.

Still in disbelief as I type this. This is disappointing on so many levels; never in my life would I have expected someone to try and steal from me in Taiwan in such a dumb way. 
I’m European, and I’d expect this kind of thing at any time, day or night, back in Europe — but not here. And definitely not as a passenger in a taxi.",1730687185.0,223,whitepalladin,WatchMeFall10Stories,whitepalladin,1730691074.0,64,OTHER

Now here’s where it gets interesting: we return to the taxi, and as I get in the backseat, the first thing I notice is that my power bank, which I’ve left right here on the backseat, is gone.

I’m very sure I left the power bank on the backseat (I didn’t take it with me to the cake store), so I start looking around for it. Finally I say to my friend, “This is strange, but I had my power bank right here on the seat, and now it’s gone.”

As we head back, we ask the taxi driver multiple times if he’s seen our power bank or if anyone else might have entered the taxi and taken it, but he denies it.

This really puzzles me since I’m certain I left the power bank on the back seat so no one else except the taxi driver could have moved it.

This is a high-end power bank that’s been useful on countless occasions, so I don’t want to just let it go.

We tell the taxi driver that once we arrive, we want to search the car.

We stop on a different street near our destination (I don’t want the taxi driver to know exactly where we’re going), pay the fare, and start looking around.

After a few minutes of searching (including the front glovebox), we’re running out of options—but I know the power bank is somewhere in this car.

I’m tired at this point and just want to end this and get on with the rest of my evening.

So I get out of the car, open the driver’s door, and politely ask him to stand up and get out of the car.

He says he won’t stand up and insists that this is all ridiculous and he doesn’t have time for it.

His reaction makes me feel more suspicious, as it shouldn’t be a big deal for him to stand up and help us search for the lost item.

I look around his seat while he’s sitting there, and then I spot a shiny USB cable coming out from literally beneath him.

I reach out (screw his personal space at this point), grab the cable, and pull the power bank from under his ass.

What. The. Fuck.

So he’s taken it from the back seat while we were away, hid it under his ass, and has been sitting on it the whole time while we search for it like dummies 😭😭

Speechless, I give him that “what the fuck, dude” look and shut the door. 

I am tired, I just want to go home.

The moment I shut the door, he quickly drives off, so I don’t have enough time to snap a photo of his car plate.

Still in disbelief as I type this. This is disappointing on so many levels; never in my life would I have expected someone to try and steal from me in Taiwan in such a dumb way.

So yesterday (Sunday), a friend of mine (Taiwanese) is supposed to pick up a cake from a local pastry shop in Taipei.

Initially, the plan is for me to drive there, but since it’s Sunday and traffic is everywhere, I really don’t want to deal with finding a car parking spot later again (I found a sweet spot and just wanted to keep it), so we decide to take a taxi instead.

He says he won’t stand up and insists that this is all ridiculous and he doesn’t have time for it.

His reaction makes me feel more suspicious, as it shouldn’t be a big deal for him to stand up and help us search for the lost item.

I look around his seat while he’s sitting there, and then I spot a shiny USB cable coming out from literally beneath him.

I reach out (screw his personal space at this point), grab the cable, and pull the power bank from under his ass.

What. The. Fuck.

So he’s taken it from the back seat while we were away, hid it under his ass, and has been sitting on it the whole time while we search for it like dummies 😭😭

Speechless, I give him that “what the fuck, dude” look and shut the door. 

I am tired, I just want to go home.

The moment I shut the door, he quickly drives off, so I don’t have enough time to snap a photo of his car plate.

So yesterday (Sunday), a friend of mine (Taiwanese) is supposed to pick up a cake from a local pastry shop in Taipei.

Initially, the plan is for me to drive there, but since it’s Sunday and traffic is everywhere, I really don’t want to deal with finding a car parking spot later again (I found a sweet spot and just wanted to keep it), so we decide to take a taxi instead.

Uber has at least 10min wait time, and we see 2-3 taxis pass by already, so we just wave, and one minute later we’re inside a yellow car, heading toward our destination.

The plan is to get to the store, pick up the cake, and then take the same taxi back home.

We arrive near the cake place and ask the taxi driver if he can wait for us for two minutes since we’ll be back soon.

Now here’s where it gets interesting: we return to the taxi, and as I get in the backseat, the first thing I notice is that my power bank, which I’ve left right here on the backseat, is gone.

I’m very sure I left the power bank on the backseat (I didn’t take it with me to the cake store), so I start looking around for it. Finally I say to my friend, “This is strange, but I had my power bank right here on the seat, and now it’s gone.”

As we head back, we ask the taxi driver multiple times if he’s seen our power bank or if anyone else might have entered the taxi and taken it, but he denies it.

This really puzzles me since I’m certain I left the power bank on the back seat so no one else except the taxi driver could have moved it.

This is a high-end power bank that’s been useful on countless occasions, so I don’t want to just let it go.

We tell the taxi driver that once we arrive, we want to search the car.

We stop on a different street near our destination (I don’t want the taxi driver to know exactly where we’re going), pay the fare, and start looking around.

After a few minutes of searching (including the front glovebox), we’re running out of options—but I know the power bank is somewhere in this car.

I’m tired at this point and just want to end this and get on with the rest of my evening.

So yesterday (Sunday), a friend of mine (Taiwanese) is supposed to pick up a cake from a local pastry shop in Taipei.

Initially, the plan is for me to drive there, but since it’s Sunday and traffic is everywhere, I really don’t want to deal with finding a car parking spot later again (I found a sweet spot and just wanted to keep it), so we decide to take a taxi instead.

Uber has at least 10min wait time, and we see 2-3 taxis pass by already, so we just wave, and one minute later we’re inside a yellow car, heading toward our destination.

The plan is to get to the store, pick up the cake, and then take the same taxi back home.

We arrive near the cake place and ask the taxi driver if he can wait for us for two minutes since we’ll be back soon.

Now here’s where it gets interesting: we return to the taxi, and as I get in the backseat, the first thing I notice is that my power bank, which I’ve left right here on the backseat, is gone.

I’m very sure I left the power bank on the backseat (I didn’t take it with me to the cake store), so I start looking around for it. Finally I say to my friend, “This is strange, but I had my power bank right here on the seat, and now it’s gone.”

As we head back, we ask the taxi driver multiple times if he’s seen our power bank or if anyone else might have entered the taxi and taken it, but he denies it.

This really puzzles me since I’m certain I left the power bank on the back seat so no one else except the taxi driver could have moved it.

This is a high-end power bank that’s been useful on countless occasions, so I don’t want to just let it go.

We tell the taxi driver that once we arrive, we want to search the car.

We stop on a different street near our destination (I don’t want the taxi driver to know exactly where we’re going), pay the fare, and start looking around.

After a few minutes of searching (including the front glovebox), we’re running out of options—but I know the power bank is somewhere in this car.

I’m tired at this point and just want to end this and get on with the rest of my evening.

So I get out of the car, open the driver’s door, and politely ask him to stand up and get out of the car.

He says he won’t stand up and insists that this is all ridiculous and he doesn’t have time for it.

His reaction makes me feel more suspicious, as it shouldn’t be a big deal for him to stand up and help us search for the lost item.

I look around his seat while he’s sitting there, and then I spot a shiny USB cable coming out from literally beneath him.

I reach out (screw his personal space at this point), grab the cable, and pull the power bank from under his ass.

What. The. Fuck.

So he’s taken it from the back seat while we were away, hid it under his ass, and has been sitting on it the whole time while we search for it like dummies 😭😭

Speechless, I give him that “what the fuck, dude” look and shut the door. 

I am tired, I just want to go home.

The moment I shut the door, he quickly drives off, so I don’t have enough time to snap a photo of his car plate.

I’m very sure I left the power bank on the backseat (I didn’t take it with me to the cake store), so I start looking around for it. Finally I say to my friend, “This is strange, but I had my power bank right here on the seat, and now it’s gone.”

As we head back, we ask the taxi driver multiple times if he’s seen our power bank or if anyone else might have entered the taxi and taken it, but he denies it.

This really puzzles me since I’m certain I left the power bank on the back seat so no one else except the taxi driver could have moved it.

This is a high-end power bank that’s been useful on countless occasions, so I don’t want to just let it go.

We tell the taxi driver that once we arrive, we want to search the car.

We stop on a different street near our destination (I don’t want the taxi driver to know exactly where we’re going), pay the fare, and start looking around.

After a few minutes of searching (including the front glovebox), we’re running out of options—but I know the power bank is somewhere in this car.

I’m tired at this point and just want to end this and get on with the rest of my evening.

So I get out of the car, open the driver’s door, and politely ask him to stand up and get out of the car.

He says he won’t stand up and insists that this is all ridiculous and he doesn’t have time for it.

His reaction makes me feel more suspicious, as it shouldn’t be a big deal for him to stand up and help us search for the lost item.

I look around his seat while he’s sitting there, and then I spot a shiny USB cable coming out from literally beneath him.

I reach out (screw his personal space at this point), grab the cable, and pull the power bank from under his ass.

What. The. Fuck.

So he’s taken it from the back seat while we were away, hid it under his ass, and has been sitting on it the whole time while we search for it like dummies 😭😭

Speechless, I give him that “what the fuck, dude” look and shut the door. 

I am tired, I just want to go home.

The moment I shut the door, he quickly drives off, so I don’t have enough time to snap a photo of his car plate.

So yesterday (Sunday), a friend of mine (Taiwanese) is supposed to pick up a cake from a local pastry shop in Taipei.

Initially, the plan is for me to drive there, but since it’s Sunday and traffic is everywhere, I really don’t want to deal with finding a car parking spot later again (I found a sweet spot and just wanted to keep it), so we decide to take a taxi instead.

Uber has at least 10min wait time, and we see 2-3 taxis pass by already, so we just wave, and one minute later we’re inside a yellow car, heading toward our destination.

"TECO Atlanta wont pick up the phone, less than 30 days before i leave",1gjp3yh,"Good afternoon everyone. I married a Taiwanese woman this time last year, and i am moving to Taiwan to be with her. We have been making preparations, applying to schools, getting documents ready, selling stuff, all that awesome stuff. The only issue now is that TECO Atlanta has gone MIA, and there are 2 documents that they told me i needed only 2 weeks ago. I’m set to leave on November 28th, so naturally im shitting bricks. 

We have been in regular touch since august. I dont know if they confused which visa i am pursuing (visitors for relatives to be turned into ARC), but the lady was so rude! I dont have a car because it was totaled 3 months before leaving. Didnt seem wise to buy another one, so i tell her i will need to find a way to get to the office (i am 1.5 hours away by car) and she tells me its none of her business which shocked me. 

She made comments about how nobody has ever asked these many questions (6 questions in bullet points) and how started talking down to me saying things like “is this really that hard for you?” “Can you do it yourself? I have emails to get back to…”. She would cut me off before i could tell her why i called and ask me questions that will eventually deduce what i was trying to ask from the get go, and once again “oh thats it? Why didnt you just say so, thats so simple”

Im sure she was busy, but i was cordial!! How she treated me was unnecessary, i wanted to have a good relations with them after all. There was no warning for it either. Idk what im going to do about this visa thing. Thanks for listening to my 5 minute rant.

Didnt seem wise to buy another one, so i tell her i will need to find a way to get to the office (i am 1.5 hours away by car) and she tells me its none of her business which shocked me. 

She made comments about how nobody has ever asked these many questions (6 questions in bullet points) and how started talking down to me saying things like “is this really that hard for you?” “Can you do it yourself? I have emails to get back to…”. She would cut me off before i could tell her why i called and ask me questions that will eventually deduce what i was trying to ask from the get go, and once again “oh thats it? Why didnt you just say so, thats so simple”

Im sure she was busy, but i was cordial!! How she treated me was unnecessary, i wanted to have a good relations with them after all. There was no warning for it either. Idk what im going to do about this visa thing. Thanks for listening to my 5 minute rant. 

Does anybody know how I can get around her? She is the only rep right now as the other is OOO and the other TECOs wont help. Ive already called, and they always instruct me to call the Atlanta office. Wild. Thank you for any help though",1730753993.0,0,Ashbadashed,Conscious_Durian_159,Ashbadashed,1730763554.0,2,OTHER

Master’s degree at NTU vs europe,1gj8627,"I’m graduating with a bachelor’s in engineering and weighing whether to continue at my own school in Finland (Decently well recognised and ranked engineering university, top 150-200) vs applying to NTU.

I did an exchange period at NTUST and really miss the studying life in Taipei. After my undergrad I’ve decided that the semiconductor industry is where I want to focus on. The industry is growing all over the world, including Finland where I’m from. I also have a lot of friends in Taiwan and generally wouldn’t mind working here at least while I’m young and don’t have kids.

My step mom is bipolar who refuses to seek medical treatment.  When she is manic (a lot recently). She can talk a lot of shit and do things considered dangerous to my father who is currently ill in the hospital.  

Are there any social services in Taiwan that can force mandatory psychiatric treatment/assessment like in North America 

I tried reaching out the police but they don't want to get involved.  Sayings it a family matter.  

The doctors and nurses all see the signs and are concerned, but when asked to provide a witness statement or report they dont want to get involved.

Best (or favorite) Enka songs? (臺語演歌),1gitb0p,"If you don’t know Enka, you might have still heard it—maybe on a taxi radio or echoing from a karaoke tent in the mountains. Here is an introduction:

>Enka originates from Japan and has been popularized in Taiwan in the 60's and 70's, in songs of nostalgic feelings, a certain longing for the ""lost home"" (hint: *the mainland*), or shared identity through love and companionship. Here is [one example](https://youtu.be/yp3jvxW-LyM), released in 1992.

Since the most popular Taiwanese Enka songs are in Hokkien (臺語 / Táiyǔ), I would argue that Enka also served as a refuge for expressing and celebrating the Taiwanese language during an era when it was politically marginalized under pre-1987 (end of martial law) KMT rule.

If you know Taiwanese Enka very well, do you have any favorite tracks or authentic recordings? I’m especially interested in good-quality recordings (no tacky TV stage performances, if possible) that really capture the artistic side of this genre. Feel free to share any playlists, albums, or even recommendations for live Enka performances in Taiwan.

Reason: I'm putting together my own curated playlist to share with my friends, local and abroad. **Thank you for your contributions!**",1730657784.0,3,TomFichtnerLeipzig,jazz4,TomFichtnerLeipzig,1730671101.0,3,CULTURAL

Where to buy hair products?,1gj1xm4,"I know this might be silly, but I’m definitely unsure where to buy hair conditioner specifically. I have curly hair and conditioner is a pretty big part of my hair routine, but since I’m traveling Taiwan I figured I could just buy some here for my stay. I’m extremely aware that I’m a little out of my element in terms of reading traditional characters, so that also plays a small part. I tried going to a nearby 7/11 but couldn’t really tell if they had any small bottles or if it was all just soap and shampoo.
I don’t need anything fancy really, just something convenient.

University Grad/Masters Admissions at Taiwan Universities ,1gittjc,"您好 r/taiwan !

Although I have yet to finish my studies and decide a career path (and gain a bit of work experience too), I was wondering (with a bit of daydreaming/what-if sparkled on top) how difficult would be for me to get admitted into a masters in Taiwan(namely NTU, National Tsing Hua, NTUST... ), since from what I saw online, their admissions rates seems to be relatively high (hovering between 30-50%), for the reputation they hold.

For a bit of background info: I'm a computer engineering undergrad student with a 7.7(not bad but not perfect either) average on the Spanish grading system (a 5 is the passing grade and roughly equivalent to a 60%), and planning to get a few undergrad research and normal internships to get a grasp of what I want to do after I finish my degree. As for languages, I currently possess an English level of 203 (Cambridge CAE), a few dabbles in French and Esperanto, and I'm planning to study Chinese over the summer holidays.

Regarding why Taiwan, setting aside the relevancy it has on my sector, after an exchange semester at Shih Chien University, I fell in love with the food and culture(and the Taipei metro!), and to be honest I wouldn't mind spending a few years in living and studying in Taiwan.

Taiwanese people are the most rude hostile people I’ve ever met in my life and Taiwan is much worse than other countries in Asia.,1gjemct,"Having just had yet another rude hostile interaction with a Taiwanese, this time in family mart, I now feel so fed up with Taiwan and the Taiwanese and want to leave ASAP. This woman at family mart literally shouted at me for daring to ask for syrup in my coffee. She shouted at me in Chinese in front of some other customers and I was so embarrassed and I had no idea what she was saying.

On Friday I made a post detailing how I felt Taiwan wasn’t what a lot of people on this sub make it out to be and now I want to give a follow up with some further points for the benefit of people in the rest of the world who may be considering Taiwan as a place to live.

Let’s start with the “Taiwanese are so friendly” nonsense

Since coming here I’ve had to deal with so many hostile people, with several Interactions a week like the one I mentioned that happened to me today. Everyone looks at you like you’re an alien. Parents pull their children away from you. You walk into a restaurant and the staff try to ignore you. In my condo people are so unfriendly they will wait for another lift rather than getting into the same lift as someone else. My hotel I stayed at when I first got here, the staff tried to get everyone using a self-check in because they didn’t want to have to interact with anyone. Service staff would rather blame you than accepting their mistakes. The whole culture feels incredible rude and hostile.

I would advise anyone coming here to not expect to make a single Taiwanese friend, they don’t want to be friends. They don’t even get on well with each other, if you str and look at the people walking on the road or in a ma they will all have grumpy hostile face expressions. Groups of people walk together but they don’t talk or laugh with each other, they would rather just walk silently. Same in a restaurant, restaurants are often very quiet because nobody is talking to each other, they all just eat and look at their phones.

I would also advise anyone coming here that any potentially friendly interaction you have with a Taiwanese will be immensely fake and they will be hoping you leave them and go away as soon as possible or give them something (money).

I don’t mind this since I’m only here temporarily and I came with some other foreign friends but it would be very tough if you’re planning to move here long term.

Some other things which I really hate about Taiwan that never gets mentioned on this sub.

1. The public toilets. This supposedly developed modern country still has disgusting squat toilets all over the place. No modern country has these. Most supposedly poorer countries in south east Asia now have sit down toilets with bum gun as standard, Japan and Korea have bidet toilets as standard. Taiwan is terribly far behind with this.

2. Together with the squat toilets you will see bins full of disgusting soiled toilet paper. This is totally unnecessary and disgusting. I’ve never seen this anywhere else and it makes me hate Taiwan everytime I see it.

3. The weather here is consistently awful. Summer is so unbearably hot you can’t even go outside at night without sweating (this is different to SE Asia where temperature cools down significantly at night). Mos days are horribly grey, rainy and overcast. I’ve counted 18 rainy days in a row since I came here as well as 2 typhoons. You’ll be forced to spend a lot of time indoors if you come to Taiwan.

4. The night markets. I can’t believe these are actual tourist attractions. They are hot, crowded and dirty with nowhere to sit. Go to Thailand if you want night markets. In Thailand every stand has ample seats and tables around it to sit and eat. As well as lots of clothes and accessory shops thrown in and concert stages for live bands to perform on (it’s really fun). You certainly won’t get that in Taiwan.

5. The garbage collection. Fortunately I don’t have to deal with this nonsense where I live. But the whole garbage collection situation is so ridiculous and unnecessary. The fact anyone can describe Taiwan as a convenient country when they have this system blows my mind.

6. Things take ages to repair when broken. One of The elevators broke in my building and wasn’t repaired for about two weeks, everywhere else I’ve lived this would be fixed in a day or 2 max. Not to mention the fact places are constantly turning off the elevators “to save electricity” forcing everyone to wait longer.

7. Constant sewage smell everywhere. When you’re walking just outside 101 mall you don’t expect to be breathing in sewage. Enough said.

8. Terrible tourist infrastructure. It’s embarrassing when people come to visit me and I have to recommend such a bad selection of hotels for them to stay at. Not to mention the fact all the beaches here are totally undeveloped with no beach resorts, beach clubs etc like other countries. A lot of beaches here are covered in garbage.

9. Bad breath everywhere. I’ve never come across so many otherwise perfectly respectable people who otherwise have terrible breath as in Taiwan. Especially in the morning. It is so disgusting and I don’t know why it’s so bad here. 


I'm posting this to give some balance to this incredibly delusion sub. We had someone yesterday asking something about the paper towels in restaurants and phrasing their question ""I love taiwan but ......?, I love Taiwan so much"" like seriously just ask your question. Pretty much every other country sub that I'm on people can just ask their questions and make comments about a place without all this weird profession of love that we see here.

Anyway downvote away 😉

Mos days are horribly grey, rainy and overcast. I’ve counted 18 rainy days in a row since I came here as well as 2 typhoons. You’ll be forced to spend a lot of time indoors if you come to Taiwan.

4. The night markets. I can’t believe these are actual tourist attractions. They are hot, crowded and dirty with nowhere to sit. Go to Thailand if you want night markets. In Thailand every stand has ample seats and tables around it to sit and eat. As well as lots of clothes and accessory shops thrown in and concert stages for live bands to perform on (it’s really fun). You certainly won’t get that in Taiwan.

5. The garbage collection. Fortunately I don’t have to deal with this nonsense where I live. But the whole garbage collection situation is so ridiculous and unnecessary. The fact anyone can describe Taiwan as a convenient country when they have this system blows my mind.

6. Things take ages to repair when broken. One of The elevators broke in my building and wasn’t repaired for about two weeks, everywhere else I’ve lived this would be fixed in a day or 2 max. Not to mention the fact places are constantly turning off the elevators “to save electricity” forcing everyone to wait longer.

7. Constant sewage smell everywhere. When you’re walking just outside 101 mall you don’t expect to be breathing in sewage. Enough said.

8. Terrible tourist infrastructure. It’s embarrassing when people come to visit me and I have to recommend such a bad selection of hotels for them to stay at. Not to mention the fact all the beaches here are totally undeveloped with no beach resorts, beach clubs etc like other countries. A lot of beaches here are covered in garbage.

9. Bad breath everywhere. I’ve never come across so many otherwise perfectly respectable people who otherwise have terrible breath as in Taiwan. Especially in the morning. It is so disgusting and I don’t know why it’s so bad here. 


I'm posting this to give some balance to this incredibly delusion sub. We had someone yesterday asking something about the paper towels in restaurants and phrasing their question ""I love taiwan but ......?, I love Taiwan so much"" like seriously just ask your question. Pretty much every other country sub that I'm on people can just ask their questions and make comments about a place without all this weird profession of love that we see here.

Taiwanese people are the most rude hostile people I’ve ever met in my life and Taiwan is much worse than other countries in Asia.,1gjemct,"Having just had yet another rude hostile interaction with a Taiwanese, this time in family mart, I now feel so fed up with Taiwan and the Taiwanese and want to leave ASAP. This woman at family mart literally shouted at me for daring to ask for syrup in my coffee. She shouted at me in Chinese in front of some other customers and I was so embarrassed and I had no idea what she was saying.

On Friday I made a post detailing how I felt Taiwan wasn’t what a lot of people on this sub make it out to be and now I want to give a follow up with some further points for the benefit of people in the rest of the world who may be considering Taiwan as a place to live.

Let’s start with the “Taiwanese are so friendly” nonsense

Since coming here I’ve had to deal with so many hostile people, with several Interactions a week like the one I mentioned that happened to me today. Everyone looks at you like you’re an alien. Parents pull their children away from you. You walk into a restaurant and the staff try to ignore you. In my condo people are so unfriendly they will wait for another lift rather than getting into the same lift as someone else. My hotel I stayed at when I first got here, the staff tried to get everyone using a self-check in because they didn’t want to have to interact with anyone. Service staff would rather blame you than accepting their mistakes. The whole culture feels incredible rude and hostile.

I would advise anyone coming here to not expect to make a single Taiwanese friend, they don’t want to be friends. They don’t even get on well with each other, if you str and look at the people walking on the road or in a ma they will all have grumpy hostile face expressions. Groups of people walk together but they don’t talk or laugh with each other, they would rather just walk silently. Same in a restaurant, restaurants are often very quiet because nobody is talking to each other, they all just eat and look at their phones.

I would also advise anyone coming here that any potentially friendly interaction you have with a Taiwanese will be immensely fake and they will be hoping you leave them and go away as soon as possible or give them something (money).

I don’t mind this since I’m only here temporarily and I came with some other foreign friends but it would be very tough if you’re planning to move here long term.

Some other things which I really hate about Taiwan that never gets mentioned on this sub.

1. The public toilets. This supposedly developed modern country still has disgusting squat toilets all over the place. No modern country has these. Most supposedly poorer countries in south east Asia now have sit down toilets with bum gun as standard, Japan and Korea have bidet toilets as standard. Taiwan is terribly far behind with this.

2. Together with the squat toilets you will see bins full of disgusting soiled toilet paper. This is totally unnecessary and disgusting. I’ve never seen this anywhere else and it makes me hate Taiwan everytime I see it.

3. The weather here is consistently awful. Summer is so unbearably hot you can’t even go outside at night without sweating (this is different to SE Asia where temperature cools down significantly at night).

Mos days are horribly grey, rainy and overcast. I’ve counted 18 rainy days in a row since I came here as well as 2 typhoons. You’ll be forced to spend a lot of time indoors if you come to Taiwan.

4. The night markets. I can’t believe these are actual tourist attractions. They are hot, crowded and dirty with nowhere to sit. Go to Thailand if you want night markets. In Thailand every stand has ample seats and tables around it to sit and eat. As well as lots of clothes and accessory shops thrown in and concert stages for live bands to perform on (it’s really fun). You certainly won’t get that in Taiwan.

5. The garbage collection. Fortunately I don’t have to deal with this nonsense where I live. But the whole garbage collection situation is so ridiculous and unnecessary. The fact anyone can describe Taiwan as a convenient country when they have this system blows my mind.

6. Things take ages to repair when broken. One of The elevators broke in my building and wasn’t repaired for about two weeks, everywhere else I’ve lived this would be fixed in a day or 2 max. Not to mention the fact places are constantly turning off the elevators “to save electricity” forcing everyone to wait longer.

7. Constant sewage smell everywhere. When you’re walking just outside 101 mall you don’t expect to be breathing in sewage. Enough said.

8. Terrible tourist infrastructure. It’s embarrassing when people come to visit me and I have to recommend such a bad selection of hotels for them to stay at. Not to mention the fact all the beaches here are totally undeveloped with no beach resorts, beach clubs etc like other countries. A lot of beaches here are covered in garbage.

9. Bad breath everywhere. I’ve never come across so many otherwise perfectly respectable people who otherwise have terrible breath as in Taiwan. Especially in the morning. It is so disgusting and I don’t know why it’s so bad here. 


I'm posting this to give some balance to this incredibly delusion sub. We had someone yesterday asking something about the paper towels in restaurants and phrasing their question ""I love taiwan but ......?, I love Taiwan so much"" like seriously just ask your question. Pretty much every other country sub that I'm on people can just ask their questions and make comments about a place without all this weird profession of love that we see here.

Taiwanese people are the most rude hostile people I’ve ever met in my life and Taiwan is much worse than other countries in Asia.,1gjemct,"Having just had yet another rude hostile interaction with a Taiwanese, this time in family mart, I now feel so fed up with Taiwan and the Taiwanese and want to leave ASAP. This woman at family mart literally shouted at me for daring to ask for syrup in my coffee. She shouted at me in Chinese in front of some other customers and I was so embarrassed and I had no idea what she was saying.

On Friday I made a post detailing how I felt Taiwan wasn’t what a lot of people on this sub make it out to be and now I want to give a follow up with some further points for the benefit of people in the rest of the world who may be considering Taiwan as a place to live.

Let’s start with the “Taiwanese are so friendly” nonsense

Since coming here I’ve had to deal with so many hostile people, with several Interactions a week like the one I mentioned that happened to me today. Everyone looks at you like you’re an alien. Parents pull their children away from you. You walk into a restaurant and the staff try to ignore you. In my condo people are so unfriendly they will wait for another lift rather than getting into the same lift as someone else. My hotel I stayed at when I first got here, the staff tried to get everyone using a self-check in because they didn’t want to have to interact with anyone. Service staff would rather blame you than accepting their mistakes. The whole culture feels incredible rude and hostile.

I would advise anyone coming here to not expect to make a single Taiwanese friend, they don’t want to be friends. They don’t even get on well with each other, if you str and look at the people walking on the road or in a ma they will all have grumpy hostile face expressions. Groups of people walk together but they don’t talk or laugh with each other, they would rather just walk silently. Same in a restaurant, restaurants are often very quiet because nobody is talking to each other, they all just eat and look at their phones.

I would also advise anyone coming here that any potentially friendly interaction you have with a Taiwanese will be immensely fake and they will be hoping you leave them and go away as soon as possible or give them something (money).

I don’t mind this since I’m only here temporarily and I came with some other foreign friends but it would be very tough if you’re planning to move here long term.

Some other things which I really hate about Taiwan that never gets mentioned on this sub.

1. The public toilets. This supposedly developed modern country still has disgusting squat toilets all over the place. No modern country has these. Most supposedly poorer countries in south east Asia now have sit down toilets with bum gun as standard, Japan and Korea have bidet toilets as standard. Taiwan is terribly far behind with this.

2. Together with the squat toilets you will see bins full of disgusting soiled toilet paper. This is totally unnecessary and disgusting. I’ve never seen this anywhere else and it makes me hate Taiwan everytime I see it.

3. The weather here is consistently awful. Summer is so unbearably hot you can’t even go outside at night without sweating (this is different to SE Asia where temperature cools down significantly at night).

4. The night markets. I can’t believe these are actual tourist attractions. They are hot, crowded and dirty with nowhere to sit. Go to Thailand if you want night markets. In Thailand every stand has ample seats and tables around it to sit and eat. As well as lots of clothes and accessory shops thrown in and concert stages for live bands to perform on (it’s really fun). You certainly won’t get that in Taiwan.

5. The garbage collection. Fortunately I don’t have to deal with this nonsense where I live. But the whole garbage collection situation is so ridiculous and unnecessary. The fact anyone can describe Taiwan as a convenient country when they have this system blows my mind.

6. Things take ages to repair when broken. One of The elevators broke in my building and wasn’t repaired for about two weeks, everywhere else I’ve lived this would be fixed in a day or 2 max. Not to mention the fact places are constantly turning off the elevators “to save electricity” forcing everyone to wait longer.

7. Constant sewage smell everywhere. When you’re walking just outside 101 mall you don’t expect to be breathing in sewage. Enough said.

8. Terrible tourist infrastructure. It’s embarrassing when people come to visit me and I have to recommend such a bad selection of hotels for them to stay at. Not to mention the fact all the beaches here are totally undeveloped with no beach resorts, beach clubs etc like other countries. A lot of beaches here are covered in garbage.

9. Bad breath everywhere. I’ve never come across so many otherwise perfectly respectable people who otherwise have terrible breath as in Taiwan. Especially in the morning. It is so disgusting and I don’t know why it’s so bad here. 


I'm posting this to give some balance to this incredibly delusion sub. We had someone yesterday asking something about the paper towels in restaurants and phrasing their question ""I love taiwan but ......?, I love Taiwan so much"" like seriously just ask your question. Pretty much every other country sub that I'm on people can just ask their questions and make comments about a place without all this weird profession of love that we see here.

Taiwanese people are the most rude hostile people I’ve ever met in my life and Taiwan is much worse than other countries in Asia.,1gjemct,"Having just had yet another rude hostile interaction with a Taiwanese, this time in family mart, I now feel so fed up with Taiwan and the Taiwanese and want to leave ASAP. This woman at family mart literally shouted at me for daring to ask for syrup in my coffee. She shouted at me in Chinese in front of some other customers and I was so embarrassed and I had no idea what she was saying.

On Friday I made a post detailing how I felt Taiwan wasn’t what a lot of people on this sub make it out to be and now I want to give a follow up with some further points for the benefit of people in the rest of the world who may be considering Taiwan as a place to live.

Let’s start with the “Taiwanese are so friendly” nonsense

Since coming here I’ve had to deal with so many hostile people, with several Interactions a week like the one I mentioned that happened to me today. Everyone looks at you like you’re an alien. Parents pull their children away from you. You walk into a restaurant and the staff try to ignore you. In my condo people are so unfriendly they will wait for another lift rather than getting into the same lift as someone else. My hotel I stayed at when I first got here, the staff tried to get everyone using a self-check in because they didn’t want to have to interact with anyone. Service staff would rather blame you than accepting their mistakes. The whole culture feels incredible rude and hostile.

I would advise anyone coming here to not expect to make a single Taiwanese friend, they don’t want to be friends. They don’t even get on well with each other, if you str and look at the people walking on the road or in a ma they will all have grumpy hostile face expressions. Groups of people walk together but they don’t talk or laugh with each other, they would rather just walk silently. Same in a restaurant, restaurants are often very quiet because nobody is talking to each other, they all just eat and look at their phones.

I would also advise anyone coming here that any potentially friendly interaction you have with a Taiwanese will be immensely fake and they will be hoping you leave them and go away as soon as possible or give them something (money).

I don’t mind this since I’m only here temporarily and I came with some other foreign friends but it would be very tough if you’re planning to move here long term.

Some other things which I really hate about Taiwan that never gets mentioned on this sub.

1. The public toilets. This supposedly developed modern country still has disgusting squat toilets all over the place. No modern country has these. Most supposedly poorer countries in south east Asia now have sit down toilets with bum gun as standard, Japan and Korea have bidet toilets as standard. Taiwan is terribly far behind with this.

2. Together with the squat toilets you will see bins full of disgusting soiled toilet paper. This is totally unnecessary and disgusting. I’ve never seen this anywhere else and it makes me hate Taiwan everytime I see it.

3. The weather here is consistently awful. Summer is so unbearably hot you can’t even go outside at night without sweating (this is different to SE Asia where temperature cools down significantly at night). Mos days are horribly grey, rainy and overcast. I’ve counted 18 rainy days in a row since I came here as well as 2 typhoons. You’ll be forced to spend a lot of time indoors if you come to Taiwan.

4. The night markets. I can’t believe these are actual tourist attractions. They are hot, crowded and dirty with nowhere to sit. Go to Thailand if you want night markets. In Thailand every stand has ample seats and tables around it to sit and eat. As well as lots of clothes and accessory shops thrown in and concert stages for live bands to perform on (it’s really fun). You certainly won’t get that in Taiwan.

5. The garbage collection. Fortunately I don’t have to deal with this nonsense where I live. But the whole garbage collection situation is so ridiculous and unnecessary. The fact anyone can describe Taiwan as a convenient country when they have this system blows my mind.

6. Things take ages to repair when broken. One of The elevators broke in my building and wasn’t repaired for about two weeks, everywhere else I’ve lived this would be fixed in a day or 2 max. Not to mention the fact places are constantly turning off the elevators “to save electricity” forcing everyone to wait longer.

7. Constant sewage smell everywhere. When you’re walking just outside 101 mall you don’t expect to be breathing in sewage. Enough said.

8. Terrible tourist infrastructure. It’s embarrassing when people come to visit me and I have to recommend such a bad selection of hotels for them to stay at. Not to mention the fact all the beaches here are totally undeveloped with no beach resorts, beach clubs etc like other countries. A lot of beaches here are covered in garbage.

9. Bad breath everywhere. I’ve never come across so many otherwise perfectly respectable people who otherwise have terrible breath as in Taiwan. Especially in the morning. It is so disgusting and I don’t know why it’s so bad here. 


I'm posting this to give some balance to this incredibly delusion sub. We had someone yesterday asking something about the paper towels in restaurants and phrasing their question ""I love taiwan but ......?, I love Taiwan so much"" like seriously just ask your question. Pretty much every other country sub that I'm on people can just ask their questions and make comments about a place without all this weird profession of love that we see here.

Taiwanese people are the most rude hostile people I’ve ever met in my life and Taiwan is much worse than other countries in Asia.,1gjemct,"Having just had yet another rude hostile interaction with a Taiwanese, this time in family mart, I now feel so fed up with Taiwan and the Taiwanese and want to leave ASAP. This woman at family mart literally shouted at me for daring to ask for syrup in my coffee. She shouted at me in Chinese in front of some other customers and I was so embarrassed and I had no idea what she was saying.

On Friday I made a post detailing how I felt Taiwan wasn’t what a lot of people on this sub make it out to be and now I want to give a follow up with some further points for the benefit of people in the rest of the world who may be considering Taiwan as a place to live.

Let’s start with the “Taiwanese are so friendly” nonsense

Since coming here I’ve had to deal with so many hostile people, with several Interactions a week like the one I mentioned that happened to me today. Everyone looks at you like you’re an alien. Parents pull their children away from you. You walk into a restaurant and the staff try to ignore you. In my condo people are so unfriendly they will wait for another lift rather than getting into the same lift as someone else. My hotel I stayed at when I first got here, the staff tried to get everyone using a self-check in because they didn’t want to have to interact with anyone. Service staff would rather blame you than accepting their mistakes. The whole culture feels incredible rude and hostile.

I would advise anyone coming here to not expect to make a single Taiwanese friend, they don’t want to be friends. They don’t even get on well with each other, if you str and look at the people walking on the road or in a ma they will all have grumpy hostile face expressions. Groups of people walk together but they don’t talk or laugh with each other, they would rather just walk silently. Same in a restaurant, restaurants are often very quiet because nobody is talking to each other, they all just eat and look at their phones.

I would also advise anyone coming here that any potentially friendly interaction you have with a Taiwanese will be immensely fake and they will be hoping you leave them and go away as soon as possible or give them something (money).

I don’t mind this since I’m only here temporarily and I came with some other foreign friends but it would be very tough if you’re planning to move here long term.

Some other things which I really hate about Taiwan that never gets mentioned on this sub.

1. The public toilets. This supposedly developed modern country still has disgusting squat toilets all over the place. No modern country has these. Most supposedly poorer countries in south east Asia now have sit down toilets with bum gun as standard, Japan and Korea have bidet toilets as standard. Taiwan is terribly far behind with this.

2. Together with the squat toilets you will see bins full of disgusting soiled toilet paper. This is totally unnecessary and disgusting. I’ve never seen this anywhere else and it makes me hate Taiwan everytime I see it.

3. The weather here is consistently awful. Summer is so unbearably hot you can’t even go outside at night without sweating (this is different to SE Asia where temperature cools down significantly at night). Mos days are horribly grey, rainy and overcast. I’ve counted 18 rainy days in a row since I came here as well as 2 typhoons. You’ll be forced to spend a lot of time indoors if you come to Taiwan.

4. The night markets. I can’t believe these are actual tourist attractions. They are hot, crowded and dirty with nowhere to sit. Go to Thailand if you want night markets. In Thailand every stand has ample seats and tables around it to sit and eat. As well as lots of clothes and accessory shops thrown in and concert stages for live bands to perform on (it’s really fun). You certainly won’t get that in Taiwan.

5. The garbage collection. Fortunately I don’t have to deal with this nonsense where I live. But the whole garbage collection situation is so ridiculous and unnecessary. The fact anyone can describe Taiwan as a convenient country when they have this system blows my mind.

6. Things take ages to repair when broken. One of The elevators broke in my building and wasn’t repaired for about two weeks, everywhere else I’ve lived this would be fixed in a day or 2 max. Not to mention the fact places are constantly turning off the elevators “to save electricity” forcing everyone to wait longer.

7. Constant sewage smell everywhere. When you’re walking just outside 101 mall you don’t expect to be breathing in sewage. Enough said.

8. Terrible tourist infrastructure. It’s embarrassing when people come to visit me and I have to recommend such a bad selection of hotels for them to stay at. Not to mention the fact all the beaches here are totally undeveloped with no beach resorts, beach clubs etc like other countries. A lot of beaches here are covered in garbage.

9. Bad breath everywhere. I’ve never come across so many otherwise perfectly respectable people who otherwise have terrible breath as in Taiwan. Especially in the morning. It is so disgusting and I don’t know why it’s so bad here. 


I'm posting this to give some balance to this incredibly delusion sub. We had someone yesterday asking something about the paper towels in restaurants and phrasing their question ""I love taiwan but ......?, I love Taiwan so much"" like seriously just ask your question. Pretty much every other country sub that I'm on people can just ask their questions and make comments about a place without all this weird profession of love that we see here.

Taiwanese people are the most rude hostile people I’ve ever met in my life and Taiwan is much worse than other countries in Asia.,1gjemct,"Having just had yet another rude hostile interaction with a Taiwanese, this time in family mart, I now feel so fed up with Taiwan and the Taiwanese and want to leave ASAP. This woman at family mart literally shouted at me for daring to ask for syrup in my coffee. She shouted at me in Chinese in front of some other customers and I was so embarrassed and I had no idea what she was saying.

On Friday I made a post detailing how I felt Taiwan wasn’t what a lot of people on this sub make it out to be and now I want to give a follow up with some further points for the benefit of people in the rest of the world who may be considering Taiwan as a place to live.

Let’s start with the “Taiwanese are so friendly” nonsense

Since coming here I’ve had to deal with so many hostile people, with several Interactions a week like the one I mentioned that happened to me today. Everyone looks at you like you’re an alien. Parents pull their children away from you. You walk into a restaurant and the staff try to ignore you. In my condo people are so unfriendly they will wait for another lift rather than getting into the same lift as someone else. My hotel I stayed at when I first got here, the staff tried to get everyone using a self-check in because they didn’t want to have to interact with anyone. Service staff would rather blame you than accepting their mistakes. The whole culture feels incredible rude and hostile.

I would advise anyone coming here to not expect to make a single Taiwanese friend, they don’t want to be friends. They don’t even get on well with each other, if you str and look at the people walking on the road or in a ma they will all have grumpy hostile face expressions. Groups of people walk together but they don’t talk or laugh with each other, they would rather just walk silently. Same in a restaurant, restaurants are often very quiet because nobody is talking to each other, they all just eat and look at their phones.

I would also advise anyone coming here that any potentially friendly interaction you have with a Taiwanese will be immensely fake and they will be hoping you leave them and go away as soon as possible or give them something (money).

I don’t mind this since I’m only here temporarily and I came with some other foreign friends but it would be very tough if you’re planning to move here long term.

Some other things which I really hate about Taiwan that never gets mentioned on this sub.

1. The public toilets. This supposedly developed modern country still has disgusting squat toilets all over the place. No modern country has these. Most supposedly poorer countries in south east Asia now have sit down toilets with bum gun as standard, Japan and Korea have bidet toilets as standard. Taiwan is terribly far behind with this.

2. Together with the squat toilets you will see bins full of disgusting soiled toilet paper. This is totally unnecessary and disgusting. I’ve never seen this anywhere else and it makes me hate Taiwan everytime I see it.

3. The weather here is consistently awful. Summer is so unbearably hot you can’t even go outside at night without sweating (this is different to SE Asia where temperature cools down significantly at night). Mos days are horribly grey, rainy and overcast. I’ve counted 18 rainy days in a row since I came here as well as 2 typhoons. You’ll be forced to spend a lot of time indoors if you come to Taiwan.

My friend has an artist gold card because she did a lot of work on government projects so it seems like doing government work and promoting Taiwan is a good route to an ARC.",1730679954.0,0,Suspicious_Guard_146,ElectronicDeal4149,Suspicious_Guard_146,1730685415.0,1,CULTURAL
Yushan Day Hike Questions,1gigrxr,"Hi! I’m a tourist planning a trip for May next year to Yushan and have a few questions:

1. We plan to stay at Dongpu Lodge overnight. Can you leave your stuff there and get them after the hike?
2. After the hike, we plan to catch the bus to Sun Moon Lake (SML) from Tataka. Can’t find a way to reserve from Tataka to SML—how easy is it to grab a bus seat from Tataka to SML without a reservation?

I can’t find straightforward and recent answers to these online, so thanks in advance to those who can share their experience!",1730615100.0,2,jupiterblossoms,Flashy-Resort3131,jupiterblossoms,1730774910.0,1,CULTURAL

Question about pre-1996 Taiwanese law,1giae8p,"We're looking into proving that a Taiwanese father had full legal custody of his kids after a divorce in 1988 in Taiwan.

We see a law that was in effect at the time, article 1051, which apparently gave the father full custody barring some agreement otherwise.

"Selling a house in Taiwan, real estate agency says we are liable for repairs for 5 years after completion??",1ghr9cb,"TLDR: Sold a house in Taipei, typhoons messed it up, real estate agency says we are liable for repairs **for 5 years** after selling the house. Is this true?

Longer:
Hello, my wife's father is a Taiwanese citizen and he moved to North America around 20 years ago. When his mom died, he inherited her house in Taipei and kept renting it to the original tenants.     

Now, he fell sick a few years ago and my wife decided to sell the old house in Taipei so that he can have some money to retire. My wife and I live in Europe, so we have been going through a real estate agency in Taipei for the sale of the house.

Before the sale, the agency hired a bunch of contractors to fix things up: leaky pipes, leaky windows (lots of leaky stuff in Taipei apparently), moldy walls etc. We have paid an insane amount of money before even selling the house.

Now the house is technically sold, but there has been one of the worst typhoon seasons ever in Taiwan, so apparently things have started to leak again. The real estate agency keeps sending us bills for the repairs, even tho we do not own the house anymore, and they said that we are liable for this **for another 5 years**.

Can anyone here confirm? We fixed up a house, sold it, and now every typhoon season we are gonna have to spend tens of thousands to fix someone else's property while they get the rent money?? I am afraid we are getting scammed.

Thanks for everyone that can shed a light on it, I'm useless as I cannot read chinese and my wife's reading level is not enough for legal documents since she was raised in North America.

**中古屋瑕疵擔保責任消滅時效是 5 年**    
根據《民法》第 356 條和第 365 條規定，買方有義務在交屋後確認房屋是否有瑕疵，若有發現任何瑕疵應通知賣方，若賣方不處理，就要在通知賣方後 6 個月內向法院提起訴訟。《民法》第 356 條同時也說明了，買房的瑕疵擔保請求權在交屋後 5 年就會消滅，也就是說，《民法》保障買方可以在交屋內 5 年提出瑕疵擔保請求權。    

**中古屋保固期限習慣上以半年為限**    
然而，在中古屋買賣交易時，實務上會以 6 個月為限，因為買方如果要行使瑕疵擔保的請求權，必須提出證據，證明瑕疵是發生在交屋之前。以漏水的問題作為例子，買方如果要證明漏水是發生在交屋之前，通常會需要請專業的驗屋公司來進行驗屋，提出客觀的數據來證明。時間越久，買方自然會越難提出證據，因此，中古屋保固期限一般會是半年。",1730532733.0,32,eightnine,masa_san69,eightnine,1730533225.0,71,OTHER

Hello, my wife's father is a Taiwanese citizen and he moved to North America around 20 years ago. When his mom died, he inherited her house in Taipei and kept renting it to the original tenants.     

Now, he fell sick a few years ago and my wife decided to sell the old house in Taipei so that he can have some money to retire. My wife and I live in Europe, so we have been going through a real estate agency in Taipei for the sale of the house.

Before the sale, the agency hired a bunch of contractors to fix things up: leaky pipes, leaky windows (lots of leaky stuff in Taipei apparently), moldy walls etc. We have paid an insane amount of money before even selling the house.

Now the house is technically sold, but there has been one of the worst typhoon seasons ever in Taiwan, so apparently things have started to leak again. The real estate agency keeps sending us bills for the repairs, even tho we do not own the house anymore, and they said that we are liable for this **for another 5 years**.

Can anyone here confirm? We fixed up a house, sold it, and now every typhoon season we are gonna have to spend tens of thousands to fix someone else's property while they get the rent money?? I am afraid we are getting scammed.

Thanks for everyone that can shed a light on it, I'm useless as I cannot read chinese and my wife's reading level is not enough for legal documents since she was raised in North America.

**中古屋瑕疵擔保責任消滅時效是 5 年**    
根據《民法》第 356 條和第 365 條規定，買方有義務在交屋後確認房屋是否有瑕疵，若有發現任何瑕疵應通知賣方，若賣方不處理，就要在通知賣方後 6 個月內向法院提起訴訟。《民法》第 356 條同時也說明了，買房的瑕疵擔保請求權在交屋後 5 年就會消滅，也就是說，《民法》保障買方可以在交屋內 5 年提出瑕疵擔保請求權。    

**中古屋保固期限習慣上以半年為限**    
然而，在中古屋買賣交易時，實務上會以 6 個月為限，因為買方如果要行使瑕疵擔保的請求權，必須提出證據，證明瑕疵是發生在交屋之前。以漏水的問題作為例子，買方如果要證明漏水是發生在交屋之前，通常會需要請專業的驗屋公司來進行驗屋，提出客觀的數據來證明。時間越久，買方自然會越難提出證據，因此，中古屋保固期限一般會是半年。",1730532733.0,32,eightnine,Amazing_Box_8032,eightnine,1730534591.0,48,OTHER

The real estate agency keeps sending us bills for the repairs, even tho we do not own the house anymore, and they said that we are liable for this **for another 5 years**.

Can anyone here confirm? We fixed up a house, sold it, and now every typhoon season we are gonna have to spend tens of thousands to fix someone else's property while they get the rent money?? I am afraid we are getting scammed.

Thanks for everyone that can shed a light on it, I'm useless as I cannot read chinese and my wife's reading level is not enough for legal documents since she was raised in North America.

**中古屋瑕疵擔保責任消滅時效是 5 年**    
根據《民法》第 356 條和第 365 條規定，買方有義務在交屋後確認房屋是否有瑕疵，若有發現任何瑕疵應通知賣方，若賣方不處理，就要在通知賣方後 6 個月內向法院提起訴訟。《民法》第 356 條同時也說明了，買房的瑕疵擔保請求權在交屋後 5 年就會消滅，也就是說，《民法》保障買方可以在交屋內 5 年提出瑕疵擔保請求權。    

**中古屋保固期限習慣上以半年為限**    
然而，在中古屋買賣交易時，實務上會以 6 個月為限，因為買方如果要行使瑕疵擔保的請求權，必須提出證據，證明瑕疵是發生在交屋之前。以漏水的問題作為例子，買方如果要證明漏水是發生在交屋之前，通常會需要請專業的驗屋公司來進行驗屋，提出客觀的數據來證明。時間越久，買方自然會越難提出證據，因此，中古屋保固期限一般會是半年。",1730532733.0,32,eightnine,bigbearjr,eightnine,1730534241.0,1,OTHER

根據《民法》第 356 條和第 365 條規定，買方有義務在交屋後確認房屋是否有瑕疵，若有發現任何瑕疵應通知賣方，若賣方不處理，就要在通知賣方後 6 個月內向法院提起訴訟。《民法》第 356 條同時也說明了，買房的瑕疵擔保請求權在交屋後 5 年就會消滅，也就是說，《民法》保障買方可以在交屋內 5 年提出瑕疵擔保請求權。    

**中古屋保固期限習慣上以半年為限**    
然而，在中古屋買賣交易時，實務上會以 6 個月為限，因為買方如果要行使瑕疵擔保的請求權，必須提出證據，證明瑕疵是發生在交屋之前。以漏水的問題作為例子，買方如果要證明漏水是發生在交屋之前，通常會需要請專業的驗屋公司來進行驗屋，提出客觀的數據來證明。時間越久，買方自然會越難提出證據，因此，中古屋保固期限一般會是半年。",1730532733.0,32,eightnine,Remarkable_Walk599,eightnine,1730614924.0,0,OTHER
"Selling a house in Taiwan, real estate agency says we are liable for repairs for 5 years after completion??",1ghr9cb,"TLDR: Sold a house in Taipei, typhoons messed it up, real estate agency says we are liable for repairs **for 5 years** after selling the house. Is this true?

Longer:
Hello, my wife's father is a Taiwanese citizen and he moved to North America around 20 years ago. When his mom died, he inherited her house in Taipei and kept renting it to the original tenants.     

Now, he fell sick a few years ago and my wife decided to sell the old house in Taipei so that he can have some money to retire. My wife and I live in Europe, so we have been going through a real estate agency in Taipei for the sale of the house.

Before the sale, the agency hired a bunch of contractors to fix things up: leaky pipes, leaky windows (lots of leaky stuff in Taipei apparently), moldy walls etc. We have paid an insane amount of money before even selling the house.

Now the house is technically sold, but there has been one of the worst typhoon seasons ever in Taiwan, so apparently things have started to leak again. The real estate agency keeps sending us bills for the repairs, even tho we do not own the house anymore, and they said that we are liable for this **for another 5 years**.

Can anyone here confirm? We fixed up a house, sold it, and now every typhoon season we are gonna have to spend tens of thousands to fix someone else's property while they get the rent money?? I am afraid we are getting scammed.

Thanks for everyone that can shed a light on it, I'm useless as I cannot read chinese and my wife's reading level is not enough for legal documents since she was raised in North America.

My experience driving at Taroko National Park after April Earthquake ,1gh5nor,"Three weeks ago, in early October, I was wondering if I can go through Taroko National Park because of the earthquake in April. I haven't seen any info online, so I'm sharing my knowledge and footage here. 

Currently the park is closed, but you can go driving through it from Guanyuan to Hualien (or the other way). You need to check that the roads are open, check the National Park website. You have three different parts and each part have different opening times to go through, so you need to calculate what time you need to go and what time you need to stop.

\*If it says only ""10:00"", it means that if you will be late in 20 minutes, it will be closed - you must be early.

When I did it, I did took a lot of stops in the park and did a small hike even though it's not accepted, nobody will stop you or check you. Iv'e made a lot of stops in the road no problem with it. I talked with the visior center and they think it will take two years to recover all the trails. The park has changed a lot, but nature is still amazing!

Please note: it can be dangerous, if you go, do it with caution!

My experience driving at Taroko National Park after April Earthquake ,1gh5nor,"Three weeks ago, in early October, I was wondering if I can go through Taroko National Park because of the earthquake in April. I haven't seen any info online, so I'm sharing my knowledge and footage here. 

Currently the park is closed, but you can go driving through it from Guanyuan to Hualien (or the other way). You need to check that the roads are open, check the National Park website. You have three different parts and each part have different opening times to go through, so you need to calculate what time you need to go and what time you need to stop.

\*If it says only ""10:00"", it means that if you will be late in 20 minutes, it will be closed - you must be early.

When I did it, I did took a lot of stops in the park and did a small hike even though it's not accepted, nobody will stop you or check you. Iv'e made a lot of stops in the road no problem with it. I talked with the visior center and they think it will take two years to recover all the trails. The park has changed a lot, but nature is still amazing!

Please note: it can be dangerous, if you go, do it with caution!

I think the problems are the workplace culture here.

I once met an Indian engineer who came to Taiwan to work for Google. He said to me that many of his Taiwanese friends strongly suggested that he should not work for Taiwanese companies.

I am not sure how far-reaching a comment like that has been in the network of foreigners. For me, I don't want to work for Taiwanese companies either.

Despite the fact that I am a local Taiwanese, I feel that the workplace culture here is not right. Working overtime without extra pay is very common here. It is like the bosses always steal employees' time. I think it is not fair.

Liability insurance as a Taiwan-based software developer (contractor) working for an overseas company?,1gharzu,"I'm currently living in Taiwan and have an APRC. I recently got a job as a contractor working for an overseas company. I'll be paid via invoices I issue. They require professional liability insurance and I've been investigating different avenues on the best way to do all this. I was wondering if anyone has experience with this and what you did? In the US this is a relatively simple process and can be done entirely online. Is there such a service in Taiwan?

Currently I've done the following: 

* Inquired with Cathay about professional liability insurance, but the agent was asking about specialized certificates. Looking at various insurance sites, I think this agent is inexperienced, so I'll likely just shop around. 

* Looked into registering an LLC which I can invoice

* Looked into doing a business as sole proprietor and how that would work. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has any experience or insight on what avenue I should take?",1730481755.0,1,algonautron,AutoModerator,algonautron,1730481755.0,1,OTHER
Any of you teach at or have kids going to “bilingual” schools? How the heck are things being fit into the curriculum?,1gh5knn,"I’m just a clueless boob interested in how 1–12 schooling is done
here nowadays compared to my days (almost two decades ago)
and this question is part of that overarching theme.
Forgive me for any gross misunderstanding.
In Taichung there are several private “bilingual” schools
like Korrnell Ritz (Taichung doesn’t have public ones yet)
but all of these are surprisingly tight‐lipped about
how they run things to the general public.
My understanding is that to be a “bilingual” school
basically every subject is taught in both Chinese and English.
Doesn’t that inflate class time quite a bit,
as you’d have to teach everything twice, give out two tests etc.?
Do kids also get basically twice the amount of homework
compared to at a “monolingual” school?
Are they nowadays just expected to spend even more time on schoolwork
or are some topics omitted from a “monolingual” curriculum to make it bilingual?

Furthermore a few of those schools claim to have a “dual‐track” curriculum (雙軌課綱)
so like they offer a domestic one and a foreign one usually American.
My understanding is because these schools are advertised as “bilingual”
and not “international” schools,
students are learning *two* countries’ worth of K12 material.
So like are students learning U.S. history and government in addition to ROC civics?
How in the world does all that extra stuff fit into their curriculum and class schedules?

Anyone here has applied for Schengen Visa at the German Institute in Taipei lately? May I know many business days it took for you to receive your Visa?

I went on my appointment on 0ct 23rd, was asked to submit more supporting documents. I sent my supporting docs right the next day but forgot to enclose the Supporting doc notice in. I just realized my mistake two days ago so I re-submitted and enclosed the Notice this morning.

Someone left a full trash bag in front of my door,1ggpkju,"I live in an apartment without a trash disposal area so the residents have to take out their own trash. My floor has 5 rooms including mine and someone left a full burnable trash bag (the one you pay for) in the corridor across from my door but it’s so narrow that it’s basically in front of my door. I’ve seen people leave out the trash outside their door quite a few times which I was never a fan of, because Taiwan is full of roaches and I want people to take care of their own garbage to keep them away rather than to just leave them in a public space. But I thought I should mind my own business and I didn’t bother to talk to my landlord about it or do anything. But last night the garbage truck was suspended and obviously now it’s been just sitting there for more than one day. Right in front of my door. I don’t appreciate this. Am I just overreacting? Is this normal?

I’m heading to Taiwan for a six-month internship and super excited to explore while I’m there. I'd love any advice on affordable travel and must-visit destinations, especially from a student-friendly perspective.

**Weather**: What can I expect over the next few months? I’ve heard Taiwan’s climate can vary, so any tips on packing essentials would be super helpful!

**Budget**: After covering my rent, I have around 12000 TWD per month for everything else. Do you think this is doable for daily essentials, or should I budget a bit more?

**Travel & Destinations**: What are the must-see places around Taiwan? I’m especially interested in affordable destinations, cultural spots, and local recommendations that might not be on every tourist's list.

Taiwan is not what people make it out to be - Be Warned! ,1gh51z4,"Having lived here for 3 months, I feel I have to challenge some of the excessive praise I see for Taiwan on this community and elsewhere. 

Having previously lived in Thailand, I’m bitterly disappointed with Taiwan. I came here expecting  a very developed modern country, with friendly people and tasty food and everything being super convenient. Well that is not what I have experienced.


Take “the Taiwanese people are so friendly”
I feel like the Taiwanese are the most hostile people I’ve ever come across in my life. I’ve had far more friendly interactions with people from every other country I’ve visited or lived in.


Some examples

I was trying on clothes at a shop and they didn’t fit so tried to hand them back to the staff member who was at the changing rooms. She just pointed and said “table”. Like wtf? In pretty much the rest of the world, they would said “oh please put it on the table” or just take it from you. 

I wanted a bag at 7-eleven and asked for a bag, here you can get small 2ntd bags and big 5ntd bags. The woman gave me the big one when I only had 3 things so I gently told her a small bag is fine. She literally snatched the bag and shoved a smaller one at me really aggressively. 

I had to pay for something at a hospital here and when I handed the money over, the woman took it without looking at me or saying a word. In most countries people would say thanks. In most Asian countries even, people bow slightly when taking money from a customer. I was quite shocked. 

I genuinely don’t understand where the “Taiwanese are so friendly” mantra comes from because I haven’t experienced it at all. Everyone walks around with a grumpy face all the time. In my building people don’t even get in the lift together if they can avoid it. Compare this to Americans, Thais, Malaysians, Italians even British and their warmth and friendliness is so much more than Taiwanese. 


Second myth is “Taiwanese food is so good”
I genuinely don’t know what people who say this used to be eating. 
What do you think tastes so nice?
Beef noodles? Oily and bland
Xiao long bao? They taste alright but nothing special
Dan bing? Any omelette in Europe is better
Deep fried rice ball? It made me want to throw up 
Pot stickers? Smells gross
Bubble tea? The bubbles are gross
And then if you want any foreign food here, it tastes horrible and it’s massively overpriced and “Taiwanfied”
Most of the local Taiwanese restaurants are pretty horrible places as well with bland walls and small stools to sit on


“Taiwan is so convenient” hahahah no

It’s not convenient not being given a precise appointment time at hospital but rather a vague 13:00-16:00.
It’s not convenient that food panda and Uber eats are mostly in Chinese
It’s not convenient that convenience stores don’t have medicine and only have 1 or 2 people working in them leaving you to queue for a long time to pay. 
It’s not convenient that I have to order by putting crosses on a piece of paper (again in Chinese) rather than being asked by a waiter/waitress. Some “restaurants” even then ask you to clear your own table! 
It’s not convenient that most restaurants are closed 14:00-17:00… what if I want to eat then
Sorry but Taiwan is not convenient. 

“Modern developed country” okay no

5 minutes driving from Taoyuan airport to the city will put that myth to bed. Most of the buildings look like Soviet mass housing. Utterly hideous and no where near on Singapore, Japan or Hong Kong’s level. When I walk down my street (which is in Xinyi, a supposedly high end area) I have a constant stench of sewage together with a lack of pavements (sidewalks). And there is a huge lack of housing. Thai middle class live in condos with rooftop pools, gyms and free parking. Taiwanese middle class live somewhere where they are luckily to have their own kitchen.  The malls here are also so boring. They are literally all the same. If you’re familiar with Bangkok’s incredible mall scene you’ll be very disappointed with Taipei. 

I can’t wait to leave this miserable place and it’s grumpy hostile people behind. 



EDIT: The responses here have been very insightful. I think the people who defend and praise Taiwan are the most fragile people I’ve ever come across, it’s like they know the place they promote is flawed and can’t bare when it gets pointed out to them. It feels like PRC levels of fragility. I highly doubt such a vindictive response would happen if I were to make a post about most other countries. 

Quite a few responses are actually agreeing with me though, which I wasn’t expecting given this is the Taiwan sub and suggests I’m not the only one to feel like this. 

I will post a part two soon, sit tight! ",1730466760.0,0,Valuable-Half1774,ImSoFuckingTired2,Valuable-Half1774,1730467642.0,22,CULTURAL

I genuinely don’t know what people who say this used to be eating. 
What do you think tastes so nice?
Beef noodles? Oily and bland
Xiao long bao? They taste alright but nothing special
Dan bing? Any omelette in Europe is better
Deep fried rice ball? It made me want to throw up 
Pot stickers? Smells gross
Bubble tea? The bubbles are gross
And then if you want any foreign food here, it tastes horrible and it’s massively overpriced and “Taiwanfied”
Most of the local Taiwanese restaurants are pretty horrible places as well with bland walls and small stools to sit on


“Taiwan is so convenient” hahahah no

It’s not convenient not being given a precise appointment time at hospital but rather a vague 13:00-16:00.
It’s not convenient that food panda and Uber eats are mostly in Chinese
It’s not convenient that convenience stores don’t have medicine and only have 1 or 2 people working in them leaving you to queue for a long time to pay. 
It’s not convenient that I have to order by putting crosses on a piece of paper (again in Chinese) rather than being asked by a waiter/waitress. Some “restaurants” even then ask you to clear your own table! 
It’s not convenient that most restaurants are closed 14:00-17:00… what if I want to eat then
Sorry but Taiwan is not convenient. 

“Modern developed country” okay no

5 minutes driving from Taoyuan airport to the city will put that myth to bed. Most of the buildings look like Soviet mass housing. Utterly hideous and no where near on Singapore, Japan or Hong Kong’s level. When I walk down my street (which is in Xinyi, a supposedly high end area) I have a constant stench of sewage together with a lack of pavements (sidewalks). And there is a huge lack of housing. Thai middle class live in condos with rooftop pools, gyms and free parking. Taiwanese middle class live somewhere where they are luckily to have their own kitchen.  The malls here are also so boring. They are literally all the same. If you’re familiar with Bangkok’s incredible mall scene you’ll be very disappointed with Taipei. 

I can’t wait to leave this miserable place and it’s grumpy hostile people behind. 



EDIT: The responses here have been very insightful. I think the people who defend and praise Taiwan are the most fragile people I’ve ever come across, it’s like they know the place they promote is flawed and can’t bare when it gets pointed out to them. It feels like PRC levels of fragility. I highly doubt such a vindictive response would happen if I were to make a post about most other countries. 

Quite a few responses are actually agreeing with me though, which I wasn’t expecting given this is the Taiwan sub and suggests I’m not the only one to feel like this.

Taiwan is not what people make it out to be - Be Warned! ,1gh51z4,"Having lived here for 3 months, I feel I have to challenge some of the excessive praise I see for Taiwan on this community and elsewhere. 

Having previously lived in Thailand, I’m bitterly disappointed with Taiwan. I came here expecting  a very developed modern country, with friendly people and tasty food and everything being super convenient. Well that is not what I have experienced.


Take “the Taiwanese people are so friendly”
I feel like the Taiwanese are the most hostile people I’ve ever come across in my life. I’ve had far more friendly interactions with people from every other country I’ve visited or lived in.


Some examples

I was trying on clothes at a shop and they didn’t fit so tried to hand them back to the staff member who was at the changing rooms. She just pointed and said “table”. Like wtf? In pretty much the rest of the world, they would said “oh please put it on the table” or just take it from you. 

I wanted a bag at 7-eleven and asked for a bag, here you can get small 2ntd bags and big 5ntd bags. The woman gave me the big one when I only had 3 things so I gently told her a small bag is fine. She literally snatched the bag and shoved a smaller one at me really aggressively. 

I had to pay for something at a hospital here and when I handed the money over, the woman took it without looking at me or saying a word. In most countries people would say thanks. In most Asian countries even, people bow slightly when taking money from a customer. I was quite shocked. 

I genuinely don’t understand where the “Taiwanese are so friendly” mantra comes from because I haven’t experienced it at all. Everyone walks around with a grumpy face all the time. In my building people don’t even get in the lift together if they can avoid it. Compare this to Americans, Thais, Malaysians, Italians even British and their warmth and friendliness is so much more than Taiwanese.

Having previously lived in Thailand, I’m bitterly disappointed with Taiwan. I came here expecting  a very developed modern country, with friendly people and tasty food and everything being super convenient. Well that is not what I have experienced.


Take “the Taiwanese people are so friendly”
I feel like the Taiwanese are the most hostile people I’ve ever come across in my life. I’ve had far more friendly interactions with people from every other country I’ve visited or lived in.


Some examples

I was trying on clothes at a shop and they didn’t fit so tried to hand them back to the staff member who was at the changing rooms. She just pointed and said “table”. Like wtf? In pretty much the rest of the world, they would said “oh please put it on the table” or just take it from you. 

I wanted a bag at 7-eleven and asked for a bag, here you can get small 2ntd bags and big 5ntd bags. The woman gave me the big one when I only had 3 things so I gently told her a small bag is fine. She literally snatched the bag and shoved a smaller one at me really aggressively. 

I had to pay for something at a hospital here and when I handed the money over, the woman took it without looking at me or saying a word. In most countries people would say thanks. In most Asian countries even, people bow slightly when taking money from a customer. I was quite shocked. 

I genuinely don’t understand where the “Taiwanese are so friendly” mantra comes from because I haven’t experienced it at all. Everyone walks around with a grumpy face all the time. In my building people don’t even get in the lift together if they can avoid it. Compare this to Americans, Thais, Malaysians, Italians even British and their warmth and friendliness is so much more than Taiwanese. 


Second myth is “Taiwanese food is so good”
I genuinely don’t know what people who say this used to be eating. 
What do you think tastes so nice?
Beef noodles? Oily and bland
Xiao long bao? They taste alright but nothing special
Dan bing? Any omelette in Europe is better
Deep fried rice ball? It made me want to throw up 
Pot stickers? Smells gross
Bubble tea? The bubbles are gross
And then if you want any foreign food here, it tastes horrible and it’s massively overpriced and “Taiwanfied”
Most of the local Taiwanese restaurants are pretty horrible places as well with bland walls and small stools to sit on


“Taiwan is so convenient” hahahah no

It’s not convenient not being given a precise appointment time at hospital but rather a vague 13:00-16:00.
It’s not convenient that food panda and Uber eats are mostly in Chinese
It’s not convenient that convenience stores don’t have medicine and only have 1 or 2 people working in them leaving you to queue for a long time to pay. 
It’s not convenient that I have to order by putting crosses on a piece of paper (again in Chinese) rather than being asked by a waiter/waitress. Some “restaurants” even then ask you to clear your own table! 
It’s not convenient that most restaurants are closed 14:00-17:00… what if I want to eat then
Sorry but Taiwan is not convenient. 

“Modern developed country” okay no

5 minutes driving from Taoyuan airport to the city will put that myth to bed. Most of the buildings look like Soviet mass housing. Utterly hideous and no where near on Singapore, Japan or Hong Kong’s level. When I walk down my street (which is in Xinyi, a supposedly high end area) I have a constant stench of sewage together with a lack of pavements (sidewalks). And there is a huge lack of housing. Thai middle class live in condos with rooftop pools, gyms and free parking. Taiwanese middle class live somewhere where they are luckily to have their own kitchen.  The malls here are also so boring. They are literally all the same. If you’re familiar with Bangkok’s incredible mall scene you’ll be very disappointed with Taipei. 

I can’t wait to leave this miserable place and it’s grumpy hostile people behind. 



EDIT: The responses here have been very insightful. I think the people who defend and praise Taiwan are the most fragile people I’ve ever come across, it’s like they know the place they promote is flawed and can’t bare when it gets pointed out to them. It feels like PRC levels of fragility. I highly doubt such a vindictive response would happen if I were to make a post about most other countries. 

Quite a few responses are actually agreeing with me though, which I wasn’t expecting given this is the Taiwan sub and suggests I’m not the only one to feel like this.

Sorry but Taiwan is not convenient. 

“Modern developed country” okay no

5 minutes driving from Taoyuan airport to the city will put that myth to bed. Most of the buildings look like Soviet mass housing. Utterly hideous and no where near on Singapore, Japan or Hong Kong’s level. When I walk down my street (which is in Xinyi, a supposedly high end area) I have a constant stench of sewage together with a lack of pavements (sidewalks). And there is a huge lack of housing. Thai middle class live in condos with rooftop pools, gyms and free parking. Taiwanese middle class live somewhere where they are luckily to have their own kitchen.  The malls here are also so boring. They are literally all the same. If you’re familiar with Bangkok’s incredible mall scene you’ll be very disappointed with Taipei. 

I can’t wait to leave this miserable place and it’s grumpy hostile people behind. 



EDIT: The responses here have been very insightful. I think the people who defend and praise Taiwan are the most fragile people I’ve ever come across, it’s like they know the place they promote is flawed and can’t bare when it gets pointed out to them. It feels like PRC levels of fragility. I highly doubt such a vindictive response would happen if I were to make a post about most other countries. 

Quite a few responses are actually agreeing with me though, which I wasn’t expecting given this is the Taiwan sub and suggests I’m not the only one to feel like this.

Taiwan is not what people make it out to be - Be Warned! ,1gh51z4,"Having lived here for 3 months, I feel I have to challenge some of the excessive praise I see for Taiwan on this community and elsewhere. 

Having previously lived in Thailand, I’m bitterly disappointed with Taiwan. I came here expecting  a very developed modern country, with friendly people and tasty food and everything being super convenient. Well that is not what I have experienced.


Take “the Taiwanese people are so friendly”
I feel like the Taiwanese are the most hostile people I’ve ever come across in my life. I’ve had far more friendly interactions with people from every other country I’ve visited or lived in.


Some examples

I was trying on clothes at a shop and they didn’t fit so tried to hand them back to the staff member who was at the changing rooms. She just pointed and said “table”. Like wtf? In pretty much the rest of the world, they would said “oh please put it on the table” or just take it from you. 

I wanted a bag at 7-eleven and asked for a bag, here you can get small 2ntd bags and big 5ntd bags. The woman gave me the big one when I only had 3 things so I gently told her a small bag is fine. She literally snatched the bag and shoved a smaller one at me really aggressively. 

I had to pay for something at a hospital here and when I handed the money over, the woman took it without looking at me or saying a word. In most countries people would say thanks. In most Asian countries even, people bow slightly when taking money from a customer. I was quite shocked. 

I genuinely don’t understand where the “Taiwanese are so friendly” mantra comes from because I haven’t experienced it at all. Everyone walks around with a grumpy face all the time. In my building people don’t even get in the lift together if they can avoid it. Compare this to Americans, Thais, Malaysians, Italians even British and their warmth and friendliness is so much more than Taiwanese. 


Second myth is “Taiwanese food is so good”
I genuinely don’t know what people who say this used to be eating. 
What do you think tastes so nice?
Beef noodles? Oily and bland
Xiao long bao? They taste alright but nothing special
Dan bing? Any omelette in Europe is better
Deep fried rice ball? It made me want to throw up 
Pot stickers? Smells gross
Bubble tea? The bubbles are gross
And then if you want any foreign food here, it tastes horrible and it’s massively overpriced and “Taiwanfied”
Most of the local Taiwanese restaurants are pretty horrible places as well with bland walls and small stools to sit on


“Taiwan is so convenient” hahahah no

It’s not convenient not being given a precise appointment time at hospital but rather a vague 13:00-16:00.
It’s not convenient that food panda and Uber eats are mostly in Chinese
It’s not convenient that convenience stores don’t have medicine and only have 1 or 2 people working in them leaving you to queue for a long time to pay.

I genuinely don’t understand where the “Taiwanese are so friendly” mantra comes from because I haven’t experienced it at all. Everyone walks around with a grumpy face all the time. In my building people don’t even get in the lift together if they can avoid it. Compare this to Americans, Thais, Malaysians, Italians even British and their warmth and friendliness is so much more than Taiwanese. 


Second myth is “Taiwanese food is so good”
I genuinely don’t know what people who say this used to be eating. 
What do you think tastes so nice?
Beef noodles? Oily and bland
Xiao long bao? They taste alright but nothing special
Dan bing? Any omelette in Europe is better
Deep fried rice ball? It made me want to throw up 
Pot stickers? Smells gross
Bubble tea? The bubbles are gross
And then if you want any foreign food here, it tastes horrible and it’s massively overpriced and “Taiwanfied”
Most of the local Taiwanese restaurants are pretty horrible places as well with bland walls and small stools to sit on


“Taiwan is so convenient” hahahah no

It’s not convenient not being given a precise appointment time at hospital but rather a vague 13:00-16:00.
It’s not convenient that food panda and Uber eats are mostly in Chinese
It’s not convenient that convenience stores don’t have medicine and only have 1 or 2 people working in them leaving you to queue for a long time to pay. 
It’s not convenient that I have to order by putting crosses on a piece of paper (again in Chinese) rather than being asked by a waiter/waitress. Some “restaurants” even then ask you to clear your own table! 
It’s not convenient that most restaurants are closed 14:00-17:00… what if I want to eat then
Sorry but Taiwan is not convenient. 

“Modern developed country” okay no

5 minutes driving from Taoyuan airport to the city will put that myth to bed. Most of the buildings look like Soviet mass housing. Utterly hideous and no where near on Singapore, Japan or Hong Kong’s level. When I walk down my street (which is in Xinyi, a supposedly high end area) I have a constant stench of sewage together with a lack of pavements (sidewalks). And there is a huge lack of housing. Thai middle class live in condos with rooftop pools, gyms and free parking. Taiwanese middle class live somewhere where they are luckily to have their own kitchen.  The malls here are also so boring. They are literally all the same. If you’re familiar with Bangkok’s incredible mall scene you’ll be very disappointed with Taipei. 

I can’t wait to leave this miserable place and it’s grumpy hostile people behind. 



EDIT: The responses here have been very insightful. I think the people who defend and praise Taiwan are the most fragile people I’ve ever come across, it’s like they know the place they promote is flawed and can’t bare when it gets pointed out to them. It feels like PRC levels of fragility. I highly doubt such a vindictive response would happen if I were to make a post about most other countries. 

Quite a few responses are actually agreeing with me though, which I wasn’t expecting given this is the Taiwan sub and suggests I’m not the only one to feel like this.

Taiwan is not what people make it out to be - Be Warned! ,1gh51z4,"Having lived here for 3 months, I feel I have to challenge some of the excessive praise I see for Taiwan on this community and elsewhere. 

Having previously lived in Thailand, I’m bitterly disappointed with Taiwan. I came here expecting  a very developed modern country, with friendly people and tasty food and everything being super convenient. Well that is not what I have experienced.


Take “the Taiwanese people are so friendly”
I feel like the Taiwanese are the most hostile people I’ve ever come across in my life. I’ve had far more friendly interactions with people from every other country I’ve visited or lived in.


Some examples

I was trying on clothes at a shop and they didn’t fit so tried to hand them back to the staff member who was at the changing rooms. She just pointed and said “table”. Like wtf? In pretty much the rest of the world, they would said “oh please put it on the table” or just take it from you.

Quite a few responses are actually agreeing with me though, which I wasn’t expecting given this is the Taiwan sub and suggests I’m not the only one to feel like this.

Taiwan is not what people make it out to be - Be Warned! ,1gh51z4,"Having lived here for 3 months, I feel I have to challenge some of the excessive praise I see for Taiwan on this community and elsewhere. 

Having previously lived in Thailand, I’m bitterly disappointed with Taiwan. I came here expecting  a very developed modern country, with friendly people and tasty food and everything being super convenient. Well that is not what I have experienced.


Take “the Taiwanese people are so friendly”
I feel like the Taiwanese are the most hostile people I’ve ever come across in my life. I’ve had far more friendly interactions with people from every other country I’ve visited or lived in.


Some examples

I was trying on clothes at a shop and they didn’t fit so tried to hand them back to the staff member who was at the changing rooms. She just pointed and said “table”. Like wtf? In pretty much the rest of the world, they would said “oh please put it on the table” or just take it from you. 

I wanted a bag at 7-eleven and asked for a bag, here you can get small 2ntd bags and big 5ntd bags. The woman gave me the big one when I only had 3 things so I gently told her a small bag is fine. She literally snatched the bag and shoved a smaller one at me really aggressively. 

I had to pay for something at a hospital here and when I handed the money over, the woman took it without looking at me or saying a word. In most countries people would say thanks. In most Asian countries even, people bow slightly when taking money from a customer. I was quite shocked. 

I genuinely don’t understand where the “Taiwanese are so friendly” mantra comes from because I haven’t experienced it at all. Everyone walks around with a grumpy face all the time. In my building people don’t even get in the lift together if they can avoid it. Compare this to Americans, Thais, Malaysians, Italians even British and their warmth and friendliness is so much more than Taiwanese. 


Second myth is “Taiwanese food is so good”
I genuinely don’t know what people who say this used to be eating. 
What do you think tastes so nice?
Beef noodles? Oily and bland
Xiao long bao? They taste alright but nothing special
Dan bing? Any omelette in Europe is better
Deep fried rice ball? It made me want to throw up 
Pot stickers? Smells gross
Bubble tea? The bubbles are gross
And then if you want any foreign food here, it tastes horrible and it’s massively overpriced and “Taiwanfied”
Most of the local Taiwanese restaurants are pretty horrible places as well with bland walls and small stools to sit on


“Taiwan is so convenient” hahahah no

It’s not convenient not being given a precise appointment time at hospital but rather a vague 13:00-16:00.
It’s not convenient that food panda and Uber eats are mostly in Chinese
It’s not convenient that convenience stores don’t have medicine and only have 1 or 2 people working in them leaving you to queue for a long time to pay. 
It’s not convenient that I have to order by putting crosses on a piece of paper (again in Chinese) rather than being asked by a waiter/waitress. Some “restaurants” even then ask you to clear your own table! 
It’s not convenient that most restaurants are closed 14:00-17:00… what if I want to eat then
Sorry but Taiwan is not convenient. 

“Modern developed country” okay no

5 minutes driving from Taoyuan airport to the city will put that myth to bed. Most of the buildings look like Soviet mass housing. Utterly hideous and no where near on Singapore, Japan or Hong Kong’s level. When I walk down my street (which is in Xinyi, a supposedly high end area) I have a constant stench of sewage together with a lack of pavements (sidewalks). And there is a huge lack of housing. Thai middle class live in condos with rooftop pools, gyms and free parking. Taiwanese middle class live somewhere where they are luckily to have their own kitchen.  The malls here are also so boring. They are literally all the same. If you’re familiar with Bangkok’s incredible mall scene you’ll be very disappointed with Taipei. 

I can’t wait to leave this miserable place and it’s grumpy hostile people behind. 



EDIT: The responses here have been very insightful.

How to address elders?,1gftebg,"Hi everyone! I'll be visiting family in Taiwan in November and the last time I went I had a lot of trouble addressing my elders. How do you address your family members? Sorry in advance if my pinyin is incorrect.

from what I remember:

Maternal grandfather - Ah Gong  
Maternal grandmother - Ah Mah  
Maternal aunt - (Number) Ah yi  
***Maternal aunt's husband - Unsure***  
Maternal uncle - (Number) Jojo  
***Maternal uncle's wife - Unsure***

Grandfather - unsure (passed away when I was young)  
Grandmother - Ah boh (may be Hakka)  
Aunt - (number) Gugu  
***Aunt's husband - Unsure***  
Uncle - (Number) Susu  
***Uncle's wife - Unsure***

General aunt (not related) - Ah yi?  
General uncle (not related) - susu?

I also have a very odd situation where my dad's little sister married my mom's older brother. Their kids and I joke about how we're super cousins. How would I address this aunt/uncle?

I tried googling it, but nothing really came up about Taiwan or China specific. Is addressing elders different in Taiwan and in China?

Taipei and thinking of another city … ,1gfhqeg,"I’ve been to Taipei a few times and my husband hasn’t visited since 2017 so we’re thinking of planning a trip next year! 

How is the weather like end April? (I’m from south east asia so heat is a constant, concerned more so about constant rain, typhoons ..) 

We were thinking of going to Tainan or Taichung or even Kaohsiung [if it isn’t too far to get to from taoyuan!] (perhaps 4 nights in either and 4 in Taipei) . Are there other cities you would recommend instead? 
I read that Taichung public transportation isn’t the best. 

We love a good combi of great food and history and maybe a quieter place too since Taipei will be typically crowded and modern.  

Thanks in advance 🥹🥹

Where is the money coming from?,1geuti7,"I’ve been living in Tainan for the past month and have been surprised by the amount of money I’ve seen, or at least the appearance of wealth. Riding around on the back of my friends’ scooter, I see a lot of brand new german luxury cars, teslas and Lexuses on the street. There’s fancy new high rises being built - I checked the prices out of curiosity and the cost of buying even a small apartment is quite shocking, even with the knowledge that housing price is an issue here. All of this is surprising me especially when hearing how much my friends make and the average income, which is relatively much lower. 

Who is occupying these apartments and driving the luxury cars? Obviously, the semiconductor industry is a huge source of revenue - is it all electrical engineers and fab technicians? I somehow doubt that. Is the money then mainly flowing to landlords/property investors/builders? I expected to see this kind of wealth in downtown Taipei, but seeing it in a relatively smaller town was surprising.

I’m curious to know more about how the economics work out. I’d  love to hear insights from anyone who knows more!",1730209054.0,127,NoMoreEvilHippies,bahbahblaksheep,NoMoreEvilHippies,1730214004.0,180,OTHER

Where is the money coming from?,1geuti7,"I’ve been living in Tainan for the past month and have been surprised by the amount of money I’ve seen, or at least the appearance of wealth. Riding around on the back of my friends’ scooter, I see a lot of brand new german luxury cars, teslas and Lexuses on the street. There’s fancy new high rises being built - I checked the prices out of curiosity and the cost of buying even a small apartment is quite shocking, even with the knowledge that housing price is an issue here. All of this is surprising me especially when hearing how much my friends make and the average income, which is relatively much lower.

Applying for Taiwan Passport and Household Registration and Conscription Overseas Exemption,1gg1i56,"Hi All,

So just a little background. I was born in the US to Taiwanese parents and have never had a Taiwanese Passport or Household registration. I've been looking to get move forward with applying for citizenship through my parents, but have avoided it since there was a years residency requirement, the military service requirement and I couldn't step away from the US that long, until they did away with the required stay. I've gotten the basic process of getting my passport and household registration along with the required documents. 

My question is related closer to military service requirement and being exempt due to living overseas. I know I can apply for an Overseas ID for Military Service Purposes, but wanted to know what the proper way or sequence this should all be done. I know I should get my passport before going to Taiwan to get my household registration, but what about obtaining an overseas status. Does it apply to me as someone who's lived in the US his entire life, but will only have recently gotten his citizenship. And as I need the household registration to apply for the overseas status, will I be conscripted the moment I receive my household registration?

Thanks in advance and happy to clear up any details!",1730333492.0,0,InsipiredAllure,submarino,InsipiredAllure,1730336014.0,4,POLITICAL
