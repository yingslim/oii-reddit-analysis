What city or cities has now the vibe HK had in the 80s and 90s - PART 2,1gl6qzt,"**About 3 weeks ago I posted¬†this:**

¬†

[**https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1g5lvur/what\_city\_or\_cities\_has\_now\_the\_vibe\_hk\_had\_in/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1g5lvur/what_city_or_cities_has_now_the_vibe_hk_had_in/)

¬†

**The responses were very rich in detail and very interesting, I am very glad and thankful it got such feedback.**

¬†

**My post was a general¬†one, I am going to fine tune that question and make it very specific.**

¬†

**My question is from an art world perspective, films, music,¬†theater,¬†nightlife.**

¬†

**""A sense that anything could happen and that if you worked hard enough, you could make your way.""¬†is what someone in the previous post said, and the vibes I get from 80s - 90s Hong Kong**

¬†

**But not only that, it needs to be a place where anything goes in the meaning that you create something new, and it catches on, it gets taken seriously.**

¬†

**I think 80s Hong Kong had that too, the pinnacle being the Won Kar Wai / Chris Doyle films and the Tony Leung and Andy Lau movies.**

¬†

**For something new like that to work it means people will take it seriously and run with it.**

¬†

**That means the audience, the participants¬†(crew, actors, band memebers, etc)¬†and the investors, need to have the same mindset.**

¬†

**I am not talking about people agreeing over a film or a band but a general mindset of a place that fosters a fertile ground¬†for something new to grow.**

¬†

**I would argue New York and Berlin had a similar vibe / mindset in the 70s.**

¬†¬†

**If anyone has new feedback after this expansion / detailing I'd be very curious to read it.**

¬†

**I am¬†going to name 2 cities not sugested in the previous thread, if you could leave your impressions on how it compares to 80's - 90s Hong Kong it would be great. (As per original post, it can be anywhere in the world and of any size)**

Guitar looking for Bass and Drums,1gl5xp6,"Hi all, 

  
**Brief self background**

>I'm an ESF kid who grew up to become, surprise, a HKU alumn (im 26 now). im sure those who know, know. I can't speak canto, though my mandarin is arguably passable for communication. Also, I can speak Korean (on the off chance lmfao)

  
**Brief musical background**

>I love my guitar but I am by no means an expert. I would rate myself as an intermediate (humbly). I can keep time though, and I really adore music and musicality and feel a responsibility to the art.   
  
My genre interest is in Jazz primarily, but also I love modern hip-hop productions, indie-rock and just straight up dad rock. I'm not really fuzzed about what ""genre"" we play as long as it is a fun time to jam.

**Trio of Bass / Drum / Guitar?**

>**I wanna bite the bullet and just form a bass/drum/guitar trio of intermediate+ players.** Experts are welcome, but I (we) our payment for your labour of babysitting us will stop at free drinks and obvious admiration. I do promise to be a good baby about it though.   
  
I hope we could have **chill jam sessions** every week or so to just spazz out away from the desperate cloy mundanity of HK work-life. Though I take the artform seriously, I take having a good time *even more* seriously.

  
If you are interested, please comment and DM me! I would be willing to provide some ""sample"" recordings of my playings if required. Though that would make me quite anxious, it is a cost I am more than willing to pay if it nets me nice jam partners. 

**P.s, if we get more people, or if a Vocalist or Keys doesn't mind playing without a bass or drum (lol)**

>**Vocalist and Keys are welcome too,** but I have much less experience jamming and making space for your instruments. If teaching me the ropes on that does not sound too onerous, please feel free to comment and DM too. ",1730919162.0,1

I was clueless and stayed at Chungking Mansions,1gl2ln8,"‚Ä¶from November 1 to November 7. This is my last night. Why? I just legit had no clue, I used Booking.com and my guest house had good reviews, I didn‚Äôt even know it was inside a massive building.

Before I talk about CK Mansions I just want to say Hong Kong is awesome, automatically one of my favourite cities in the world, and I‚Äôll 100% be back. People, food, architecture, transportation, everything was awesome. 

As for CK Mansions: I was in actual terror when I arrived. The outside of the building was filthy, the inside was somehow filthier, I was immediately approached by someone probably wanting to sell something? The elevator was very slow and packed with people who were screaming at each other.

My room is tiny (which I don‚Äôt mind), the air conditioner is *loud* and the toilet‚Äôs water is *brown*. I‚Äôll never ever make the same mistake. I‚Äôll be staying at a nice place next time.

The thing is, I can‚Äôt say my stay was terrible. My guest house, unlike the rest of the building (which is the filthiest building I‚Äôve ever been in) is always clean and smells nice. The tiny shower is okay, my sheets are clean every day. And the owner(?) is awesome. From the very beginning she‚Äôs been really friendly and helpful, recommended me restaurants and places to visit, and gave me a little Chinese style decoration tonight with a ‚Äúthanks for your stay‚Äù note.

So‚Ä¶ yeah. I‚Äôm still in disbelief that I‚Äôm typing this from inside a building where criminal activity may or may not be taking place. I‚Äôll never unsee the filthy stairs/hallways/etc. and I‚Äôll never ever step foot in here again.

But‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt leave a negative review. I kind of see why it has a good Booking.com score *all things considered*. It‚Äôs been a surreal experience, but at least it was cheap and I‚Äôll likely leave in one piece.

Anyways. Good night! Looking first to leaving the building early in the morning.",1730910814.0,107

HKID renewal question - Can you ask for two copies of the acknowledgement of application?,1gj565z,"Hi!

I have a bit of a complicated situation. I will be heading to HK in a few months to renew my (non-PR, I have RTL status) HKID card. Long story short, I will need to have someone pick up my card as I won't be in HK when pickup is ready and I know there's a limited time that the card can be picked up.

Here's the situation, my understanding is that when you exit HK while the card is in process, you need a travel document (foreign passport in my case) and the acknowledgement of application paper to show at immigration. The problem is that the person who is picking up my ID card is required to have said acknowledgement of application paper. Is there a way for me to get two copies of the acknowledgement of applicaton? One for me to exit HK and one for the person picking up my HKID card?

Here are some obvious ones I can think of:

* Have money or make lots of it 
* Being Chinese or white - obviously Chinese as the ethnic majority, and white because of systemic racial privilege
* Love dining out/shopping/travelling 
* Enjoy a ""fast-paced"", convenient or materialistic lifestyle 

But I'd go further to add (but these are more up for disagreement): 

* Introverts - there's not much small talk and you can easily keep to yourself 
* People who don't really want to integrate or meet people from different backgrounds - For expats, it's easy to get by without integrating or learning Cantonese especially if you move to certain locations like DB or mid-levels. 
* Foreigners who want to integrate - on the flip side, I also think HK being a big city with a large and dense population means that it's also easy to meet friends and integrate if you want to. There's a lot of interest groups and social activities going on. Plus, HK being not a family-friendly city means you'll meet more people in the 20s and 30s who want to meet new people and socialize, as opposed to settling down and having children. 
* Conformists - HK can be a pretty judgemental society. It's not great for artists, or people living non-mainstream lifestyles. But if you're a ""typical model of success"" by HK standards (heterosexual, university educated, high income, in the rat race, believes in the face concept), then HK can feel very safe to you. 
* Politically apathetic - self explanatory. Bonus if they only care about safety and social harmony above all else.

Hong Kong Layover Help,1giwr4r,"
Hi everyone!

I am looking to get some help planning my trip to Macau as an NZ Citizen. I have a layover arriving in Hong Kong International Airport 4:20 PM Jan 31 2025 and then leaving to my next destination Feb 1 4:15 PM.

In my head I plan to go through Hong Kong immigration, drop off my suitcase at a bag storage in the airport and travel around with a back pack. 

Make my way to Macau and check in at one of the cheaper hotels in the Ponte 16 area. Look at the attractions there and grab a meal (looking for suggestions)

Visit the Cotai Strip and have a play around in the casinos and touring the area. 

Leave the next morning to Hong Kong, eat at Kam‚Äôs Roast Goose and then do shopping of some kind if time allows (suggestions please) and then try to be back at the airport around 2PM.

My questions are:

If this plan sounds feasible or if there is a better way to do this?

When and where would I go through immigration, is it at the ports and will I need to do this before I can go on the HZMB busses (what is the process)?

The time I visit will be Chinese New Year apparently, so do I need to account for shops being closed and will there be different schedules for transport and stores?

And currency wise, should I carry HKD, Patacas, both and how much would be a reasonable budget?

Just any other tips, suggestions or advice you have as well :)

Thanks to all those that can help me, really appreciate it!!

From Lost Youth to Verdict: Five Years in Limbo for Hong Kong Twin Brothers,1giiky2,"# From Lost Youth to Verdict: Five Years in Limbo for Hong Kong Twin Brothers

On July 1, 2019, as Hong Kong marked its 22nd anniversary of the handover to China, the city witnessed one of its most tumultuous days. Among the thousands who gathered near the government headquarters in Admiralty were two 14-year-old twin brothers, **Dai Ka-ping (Êà¥ÂòâÂπ≥) and Dai Ka-ching (Êà¥ÂòâÊ≠£)**.

The twins were among four defendants recently sentenced by Deputy District Judge David Cheung (Êö´ÂßîÂçÄÂüüÊ≥ïÈô¢Ê≥ïÂÆòÂºµÂøóÂÅâ) for their involvement in the protests. While two co-defendants received three-year prison terms, the twins were sentenced to a training centre for a minimum of six months, with the judge considering their youth at the time of the offense.

[Days before the verdict, Ka-ping voluntarily shaved his head, preparing himself for the trial's outcome. \(Photo source: HK City Creation.\)](https://preview.redd.it/mxq2x7kzenyd1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=54fd3bd72646c11dca3ff0d3eafbad609be19e8c)

The Moment That Changed Everything

The events of July 1, 2019 are etched in their memory. **""I was looking back for him, and he was looking back for me,""** Ka-ping recalls. **""When we finally found each other, police charged forward. Some protesters pushed me down, which caused him to fall too. The fall was sudden - when I opened my eyes, I saw everyone running. As I tried to get up, I saw someone in blue uniform and helmet charging towards us, swinging a baton.""**

The guilt weighs heavily on Ka-ping's conscience. **""My biggest regret is that my brother was behind me. If I hadn't fallen, he wouldn't have fallen either,""** he says, blaming himself for his brother's arrest.

But Ka-ching sees it differently. ""If I had walked away, I would have regretted it deeply. He fell right in front of me, and within a second or two, I fell too. **Yes, I might have had a chance to escape if I hadn't helped him, but if I had chosen to abandon him, I would have regretted it forever.** In that moment, there wasn't even time to think.""

During the interview, the twins offered raw, unfiltered descriptions of each other that cut to the core of their relationship. **The younger Ka-ping characterizes his brother as ""simple-minded but principled, stubborn, and socially awkward"" (""ÊàáÂ±Ö„ÄÅÊúâÂéüÂâá„ÄÅÁ°¨È†∏„ÄÅÁ§æ‰∫§ËÉΩÂäõÂ∑Æ""). Ka-ching, in turn, describes his younger brother as ""brave, undisciplined, impulsive, and all talk"" (""ÂãáÊï¢„ÄÅÁÑ°‰∫§Â∏∂„ÄÅË°ùÂãï„ÄÅÊ≠ªÂâ©ÊääÂè£"").** These candid assessments, heard by each brother for the first time, speak to the unvarnished honesty of their relationship.

Five Years in Limbo: A Lost Youth

**""Initially, I just wanted to do well in DSE, complete my student union term, make it to my birthday, to my girlfriend's birthday... who would have thought the final judgment date would fall on my father's birthday. Life plays cruel jokes,""** Ka-ping reflects. Beyond these personal milestones, he once dreamed of becoming the youngest Legislative Council member in history - a childhood aspiration now suspended in time.

**""What has this case done to me? It has destroyed everything - making any future planning impossible,""** Ka-ping says, clutching his head in visible distress.

**""I'm afraid Hong Kong will become a place I can no longer accept... Maybe when I come out, there will be things I won't be able to speak about anymore. I don't know how long I'll have to wait before I can speak freely again,""** Ka-ping shares, his concerns focused not on his own fate but on his city's future.

Despite these fears, he maintains his resolve to stay: **""I believe destiny can be changed. Maybe this time we'll have to wait longer, but we can still try to do limited things within limited space, trying our best to protect this place. Even if we have to leave, don't forget this place.""**

# Final Moments of Freedom

On the day of the verdict, Ka-ping arrived at court more than an hour early, taking photos with family, friends, and university colleagues. When the guilty verdict was announced, he nodded slightly, then turned to the public gallery, forcing himself to smile while holding both sides of his mouth. During the 15-minute recess that followed, when his family and friends were not present, witnesses say he wept, repeatedly wiping his eyes before returning to face the court.

[Dai Ka-ping \(left\) and Dai Ka-ching \(right\) share many common interests, including taekwondo and football. \(Photo source: HK City Creation\)](https://preview.redd.it/5hm3du1qfnyd1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba82f76f7d106a8f42446819b6f8676c5388877d)

**""Our political enlightenment came from our father,""** Ka-ping reveals. **""Since we were young, we would hear him talk about 'Long Hair' Leung Kwok-hung and Wong Yuk-man.""**

# ""I'm not sorry to society,"" Ka-ping states with conviction. ""I'm sorry to my family. They shouldn't have to suffer like this."" His brother adds with characteristic stoicism, ""I'm just going to live somewhere else for a while. We need to face what's coming with calmness and courage.""

In his mitigation letter to the judge, Ka-ping wrote that his concern for politics and participation in protests, even the actions that led to this case, all stemmed from his love for Hong Kong. **""Don't give yourself too much to think about, keep yourself busy,""** was the advice given by his mentor, former Democratic Party chairwoman Emily Lau (ÂäâÊÖßÂçø). He thanked not only his loved ones but also himself for managing to live well in the present moment.

While Ka-ping expressed remorse to his family, across social media platforms and comment sections, many Hong Kongers suggested that it was society that had failed its young people. The twins' story - from their arrest at 14 to their sentencing at 20 - has become, for many, a symbol of a generation's lost youth.

[With a brave smile and raised hand, Dai Ka-ping waves goodbye outside the courthouse hours before receiving his verdict, marking one of his final moments of freedom. \(Photo source: The Collective\)](https://preview.redd.it/xr6dntx6gnyd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee8550b1d960dd944419bba1e7f287d29366e000)

Context: The Training Centre System

While the judge's decision to send the twins to a training centre rather than prison was presented as a more lenient option considering their youth, Hong Kong's training centre system has faced scrutiny. The centres, which accept offenders between 14 and 20 years old, emphasize discipline and vocational training, with detention periods capped at three years.

According to accounts from former inmates and staff featured in the 2017 Hong Kong film ""With Prisoners"" (ÂêåÂõö), conditions in these facilities can be particularly challenging for young offenders. The centres operate under a strict disciplinary regime that some critics argue may be more demanding than adult prisons.

The exact duration of detention is determined by the correctional services chief, and those released may be subject to three years of supervision, including mandatory curfews and reporting requirements.

Hong Kong Cinema's Self-Censorship Era: Veteran Director Johnnie To Breaks Silence in Landmark Interview,1ghxznh,"**Hong Kong Cinema's Self-Censorship Era: Veteran Director Johnnie To Breaks Silence in Landmark Interview**

[Source: BBC \(https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SvqZc7S9D24\)](https://preview.redd.it/5p7gb27j0iyd1.png?width=1910&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff8666d020f60eb86a7738900eea29cac14a7052)

In a powerful and revealing interview with BBC News Cantonese, Johnnie To (ÊùúÁê™Â≥Ø), one of Hong Kong's most celebrated filmmakers and a director who has earned international acclaim including recognition at Cannes, Venice, and Berlin film festivals, has offered an unprecedented glimpse into Hong Kong's changing cultural landscape and the realities of filmmaking under increasing constraints.

The veteran filmmaker, whose illustrious career spans over four decades and includes critical successes like ""Election,"" ""Breaking News,"" and ""Drug War,"" finds himself at what he describes as **""the lowest point in my life""** (""ÊúÄËøëÈÉΩÊòØÊàë‰∫∫ÁîüÊúÄ‰ΩéÊΩÆÁöÑÊôÇÂÄô""). Having built a reputation for exploring themes of friendship, fate, and Hong Kong's evolving society, Johnnie To now faces profound creative challenges.

He spoke candidly about the loss of artistic freedom: **""I feel there's no soul now, including both myself and Hong Kong""** (""ÊàëË¶∫ÂæóÁèæÂú®Ê≤íÊúâÈùàÈ≠ÇÔºåÂåÖÊã¨ÊàëÂíåÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÈÉΩÊ≤íÊúâ‰∫Ü""). This crisis, he emphasized, stems from the erosion of **""human rights and freedom""** (""‰∫∫Ê¨äÂíåËá™Áî±"").

When asked about topics filmmakers must avoid, Johnnie To responded with characteristic sharp insight: **""You know what? It's strange that you're asking me this,""** (""‰Ω†Áü•ÈÅìÁöÑÔºå‰Ω†ÂïèÊàëÂæàÂ•áÊÄ™"") he remarked, before laying bare the reality of self-censorship: **""Why needlessly create confrontation? If you don't want to touch that red line, if you don't want to raise suspicions... then don't say too much about Hong Kong affairs""** (""ÁÑ°Ë¨ÇÁõ¥Êé•ÂéªË°ùÊíûÔºå‰Ω†‰∏çÊÉ≥Á¢∞Âà∞ÈÇ£Ê¢ùÁ¥ÖÁ∑öÔºåÊàñËÄÖ‰Ω†‰∏çÊÉ≥Êúâ‰∫õË¢´Êá∑ÁñëÁöÑË©±Ôºå‰Ω†Â∞±‰∏çË¶ÅË™™ÈÇ£È∫ºÂ§öÔºåÈóúÊñºÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÁöÑ‰∫ã"").

His advice was particularly telling: **""Don't talk too much regarding Hong Kong's current political situation - just make more romance films, family dramas instead""** (""‰Ω†Â∞±‰∏çË¶ÅË™™Â§™Â§öÔºåÈóúÊñºÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÁèæÂú®ÊîøÊ≤ª‰∏äÁöÑ‰∫ãÔºå‰Ω†Â∞±Â§öË™™‰∫õÊÑõÊÉÖÔºåË™™‰∫õË¶™ÊÉÖ""). 

Johnnie To offered pointed criticism of current governance approaches: **""A government with confidence wouldn't do this. They have no confidence in the people, no confidence in society""** (""Êúâ‰ø°ÂøÉÁöÑÊîøÂ∫úÊúÉÈÄôÊ®£ÂóéÔºüÂ∞ç‰∫∫Ê≤íÊúâ‰ø°ÂøÉÔºåÂ∞ç‰∫∫Ê∞ëÊ≤íÊúâ‰ø°ÂøÉÔºåÂ∞çÁ§æÊúÉÊ≤íÊúâ‰ø°ÂøÉ""). He dismissed official displays of prosperity as superficial, stating **""Setting off fireworks pretending Hong Kong is prosperous - who are you trying to fool? Even grandma won't be fooled""** (""Êîæ‰∏ãÁÖôËä±Áï∂È¶ôÊ∏ØÂæàÁπÅÊ¶ÆÔºå‰Ω†È®ôË™∞ÂïäÔºåÂ©ÜÂ©ÜÈÉΩÈ®ô‰∏ç‰∫Ü"").

Johnnie To reflected on Hong Kong's transition: **""In the 80s we talked about it, in the 90s we knew return to China was inevitable. What determined our future way of life? The Basic Law. I believed in the Basic Law,""** after a pause, he added with notable emphasis, **""I still believe in the original one""** (""ÊàëË¶∫ÂæóÔºåÊàëÁõ∏‰ø°Âü∫Êú¨Ê≥ïÔºåÁèæÂú®ÈÇÑÁõ∏‰ø°ÔºåÂéü‰æÜÈÇ£ÂÄã""). 

Despite opportunities to work overseas, the renowned director maintains an unwavering commitment to Hong Kong cinema: **""I stick to filming in Hong Kong - how can I go elsewhere when I can't even fully grasp my own culture?""** (""ÊàëÈÄ£È¶ôÊ∏ØËá™Â∑±ÊàêÈï∑ÁöÑÂú∞ÊñπÁöÑÊñáÂåñÔºåÊàëÈÉΩÊçâÂæó‰∏çÂ§†Ê∫ñÔºåÊàëÊÄéÊúÉÂéªÂà•ÁöÑÂú∞ÊñπÂ≠∏Âà•‰∫∫ÁöÑÊù±Ë•ø""). This dedication comes at a personal cost, as he reveals: **""I keep writing and throwing away scripts - I don't even know how many I've discarded""** (""ËÆäÊàêÊÉ≥ÂÆå‰∏ÄÊ¨°ÂèàÊâîÊéâÔºåÊÉ≥ÂÆå‰∏ÄÊ¨°ÂèàÊâîÊéâÔºåÈÉΩ‰∏çÁü•ÈÅìÊâî‰∫ÜÂ§öÂ∞ëÊù±Ë•ø"").

The founder of independent production house Milkyway Image (ÈäÄÊ≤≥Êò†ÂÉè) in 1996 described his current creative paralysis: **""I used to be very confident about my film concepts, but in recent years I've had many doubts""** (""Êàë‰ª•ÂâçÂ∞çÊßãÊÄù‰∏äÔºåÂ∞çÈõªÂΩ±ÁöÑ‰ø°ÂøÉÂæàÂº∑ÔºåÈÄôÂπæÂπ¥ÊúÉË¶∫ÂæóÊúâÂæàÂ§öÊá∑Áñë""). He distinguished his current struggles from past challenges, noting **""My crisis isn't about money - I haven't lost my ideals due to poverty before, but now I've lost them""** (""‰ª•ÂâçÊ≤íÊúâÈå¢Ôºå‰∏çÊòØ‰ª£Ë°®Ê≤íÊúâ‰∫ÜÊàëÁöÑÁêÜÊÉ≥ÔºåÁèæÂú®ÊòØÊ≤íÊúâ‰∫Ü"").

Johnnie To, who has served on juries at all three major international film festivals - Cannes, Venice, and Berlin, used a striking metaphor to describe the industry's current state: **""How can you fight against an elephant's foot when you're just an ant? If it steps on you, you're dead""** (""‰Ω†ÊÄéÊ®£ËÉΩÂ§†È†ÇÂæó‰Ωè‰∏ÄÈöªÂ§ßË±°ÁöÑËÖ≥Ôºå‰Ω†Âè™Êúâ‰∏ÄÈöªÁüÆÁöÑÊôÇÂÄôÔºåË∏©‰∏≠ÂøÖÊ≠ª"").

The interview comes at a critical juncture for Hong Kong cinema, as the industry grapples with new film censorship regulations and changing political dynamics. As a filmmaker known for his ability to work across genres and his distinctive style mixing realism with highly stylized elements, Johnnie To's current creative paralysis speaks to broader issues facing Hong Kong's cultural sector. **""In terms of industry and art, this is not a good era""** (""Âú®Â∑•Ê•≠‰∏ä‰πüÂ•ΩÔºåËóùË°ì‰∏ä‰πüÂ•ΩÔºåÂêÑÊñπÈù¢ÈÉΩ‰∏çÊòØ‰∏ÄÂÄãÂ•ΩÁöÑÊôÇ‰ª£""), he observed.

While the struggles he describes are well-known within Hong Kong's film industry, Johnnie To's willingness to speak openly about these challenges makes him one of the most prominent figures to publicly address the creative constraints facing Hong Kong filmmakers today. His candid revelations carry particular weight given his stature in both local and international cinema.

Why Indian grocery stores don't price tag their products?,1ghwe2u,"After a visit to a popular Indian Restaurant in Chungking Mansion, I decided to visit the  grocery stores on the ground floor to look for spices to up my curry cooking game. While we were looking around in 3 different stores we found that none of them put price tags on their products. At first we thought it might be because they were smaller so they didn't bother to do so. But the one we ended up buying from was large (also probably do wholesale business) and has a proper cash register with barcode scanner.

I bought several small bags like cumin powder after having confirmed the prices first with the cashier. Each of them costed around $12, which I thought was reasonable. But I still couldn't help but wondered if they might have two prices - one for regular Indian customers, one for non-Indian ""strays"" like me. Am I wrong to suspect that?

Having said that I would still be going back to shop there. This one has so many different spices and I want to try all of them.

Smoking in Hong Kong,1ghsee1,I've moved back to Hong Kong recently and there has been a few times where I've smelt weed in the streets in central. I use to smoke alot in the UK but have stopped since. The smell however has tempted me to get back into it. I know its illegal but do locals actually care that much if you smoke on the street? Where do people normally go to get contacts here? ,1730538284.0,0

Payment and Reloading ,1ghsb3t,"I am from the UK and plan to be in HK for 3 weeks, family of 4 adults with andriod phones. 

When in Europe using euros I used Revolut. Easy to add GBP to my account and convert it to Euros to spend via the card. Can also convert the euros back to GBP. This method means no fees just the bank conversion rate.


I know I should get the Octopus card for each person. What is the best way to reload it? I have the app and trying to play with it but need the Octopus card and HK number to make it work fully. 

Has anyone used the revolut card loaded with HKD for payment? Is there a better travel money card. 

Dont want to use my local bank/credit card as it will charge me fees on each transaction. ",1730537872.0,1
Do Hong Kong Credit Cards Usually Offer Annual Fee Waiver? ,1ghrfrt,"Relocating to HK soon and in search for a good bank and credit card. I have been using DBS in Singapore for almost 20 years, and was considering this in HK as well, owing to some familiarity with the interfaces and apps. 

But just curious, do HK credit cards come with rewards similar to Singapore ones, and can they usually _waive_ the annual fee when it comes due? I know the question may sound stupid, but without the waiver, for me, it makes little sense to have a credit card to begin with. 

In particular, I am eyeing the DBS compass card, but recommendations welcome.
