Second Trump Presidency - What would this mean for Taiwan?,1gktc5y,Share your thoughts now that Trump has won.,1730879582.0,270
Taiwanese dating culture/ pitfalls to avoid?,1gl07yl,"I met this Taiwanese lady at the gym and I've been really enjoying the conversations I've had with her. Asked for her number and we've been texting back and forth a bit. I've driven her home after the class a couple times* and we've made plans to go out on Friday night. 

I am terrible at reading people, so I'm not sure if this means she's reciprocating romantic interest or just being friendly. Given the cultural and language barrier and my general awkwardness (her English is pretty good but she misses stuff sometimes) I'm not necessarily sure that she's even *aware* that I'm attempting to show that I'm interested in her.

I've thought about just being direct about it - if the vibes are good at the end of the night Friday just telling her that I like her and I'd like to take her out again explicitly as a date,  but I don't want to make her uncomfortable or unknowingly commit some sort of huge faux pas.

Anyways,  I'd really appreciate any advice or insights you had to offer. 



*I was driving a borrowed pickup truck the one night and apparently she'd never ridden in one before - she was *so* excited and it was probably the most adorable thing I've ever seen. ",1730904595.0,31

My experience going through obtaining a driver's license in Taiwan,1gktary,"I didn't have a driver's license before Taiwan so I applied and got it here. The instructor basically told and showed me a few basic skills (parking, starting the car, turning etc), then I was on my own for the whole thing. I just went there and practiced these couple skills. There was also an online class for theoretical exam but it was in Chinese and I was told it was just basic information about driving anyway. I wasn't taught anything other than basic skills. And when the practical exam day came, the examiner kept rushing me to make it to the green lights because he didn't want to waste time waiting for the red lights. Overall, I feel like I have learned next to nothing during the whole thing.

Working APRC question,1gk34nq,"Hi everyone.

I am a foreigner who stayed in Taïwan for around 7 years and half and worked for the last 6 years here.

I'm considering applying for the APRC but I have an issue.

For now I'm working but I would like to take a year off to focus on my recent health issues and learn Chinese full time for at least a year. This means I would probably quit my current position during the next month.

As I worked 5 years and fulfill all the requirements I will go to the immigration agency this week. But will leaving my job the next month prevent me from having my APRC ?

Basically, if you worked 5 years in Taïwan and quited your job recently OR if you are in the notice period,  can you still apply for the working APRC ( the one that requires 5 years or working in Taïwan ) ?
Also, if you submitted your application for the APRC and quit before you officially receive it, does that cancel the process ?

Thanks in advance !",1730800097.0,1
Received a package that never was ordered. Now company that shipped it wants it back,1gjh0dy,"Received an unknown package that turned to be what looked like used junk with some small spiders crawling around inside. I re-taped it and placed in a  trash bag.  
After about a week i decided to just dispose of it at the recycling center of my apartment community.  A month later i got a text message from someone claiming to that the item was sent to me by mistake.  Anyone know what liabilities I may have?  
Never heard of this company and I have no idea how they got my name, address and phone number in the first place.

Amended:  
Trying to keep this short;  as some have mentioned this is probably some scam. I thought this also, so I did not bother contacting the shipper before disposing of the box of contents.   
  
However, I just did a quick google and apparently there is some law that says there may be some penalties for refusing to return mailed items shipped by mistake. I'm flabbergasted. Where I am from, we have no such obligation.

"Lost My Item in a Taxi… Or So I Thought, Until I Caught the Driver Swiping It",1gj412s,"Still in disbelief this is actually happened.

So yesterday (Sunday), a friend of mine (Taiwanese) is supposed to pick up a cake from a local pastry shop in Taipei.

Initially, the plan is for me to drive there, but since it’s Sunday and traffic is everywhere, I really don’t want to deal with finding a car parking spot later again (I found a sweet spot and just wanted to keep it), so we decide to take a taxi instead.

Uber has at least 10min wait time, and we see 2-3 taxis pass by already, so we just wave, and one minute later we’re inside a yellow car, heading toward our destination.

The plan is to get to the store, pick up the cake, and then take the same taxi back home.

We arrive near the cake place and ask the taxi driver if he can wait for us for two minutes since we’ll be back soon.

Now here’s where it gets interesting: we return to the taxi, and as I get in the backseat, the first thing I notice is that my power bank, which I’ve left right here on the backseat, is gone.

I’m very sure I left the power bank on the backseat (I didn’t take it with me to the cake store), so I start looking around for it. Finally I say to my friend, “This is strange, but I had my power bank right here on the seat, and now it’s gone.”

As we head back, we ask the taxi driver multiple times if he’s seen our power bank or if anyone else might have entered the taxi and taken it, but he denies it.

This really puzzles me since I’m certain I left the power bank on the back seat so no one else except the taxi driver could have moved it.

This is a high-end power bank that’s been useful on countless occasions, so I don’t want to just let it go.

We tell the taxi driver that once we arrive, we want to search the car.

We stop on a different street near our destination (I don’t want the taxi driver to know exactly where we’re going), pay the fare, and start looking around.

After a few minutes of searching (including the front glovebox), we’re running out of options—but I know the power bank is somewhere in this car.

I’m tired at this point and just want to end this and get on with the rest of my evening.

So I get out of the car, open the driver’s door, and politely ask him to stand up and get out of the car.

He says he won’t stand up and insists that this is all ridiculous and he doesn’t have time for it.

His reaction makes me feel more suspicious, as it shouldn’t be a big deal for him to stand up and help us search for the lost item.

I look around his seat while he’s sitting there, and then I spot a shiny USB cable coming out from literally beneath him.

I reach out (screw his personal space at this point), grab the cable, and pull the power bank from under his ass.

What. The. Fuck.

So he’s taken it from the back seat while we were away, hid it under his ass, and has been sitting on it the whole time while we search for it like dummies 😭😭

Speechless, I give him that “what the fuck, dude” look and shut the door. 

I am tired, I just want to go home.

The moment I shut the door, he quickly drives off, so I don’t have enough time to snap a photo of his car plate.

Still in disbelief as I type this. This is disappointing on so many levels; never in my life would I have expected someone to try and steal from me in Taiwan in such a dumb way. 
I’m European, and I’d expect this kind of thing at any time, day or night, back in Europe — but not here. And definitely not as a passenger in a taxi.",1730687185.0,223
Stand or Walk on Left Side Taipei MRT,1gjb6g1,"Just ran to you an individual standing on the left side of the escalator at Guting Station.  I asked him why he was standing on the left and he said there was a recent rule change / suggestion that stated individuals should stand on both sides of the escalator.

Best Taiwanese food that you think people should try?,1gj589x,"I wonder if you guys can share some of your ""must-try food"" that is not the usual ""go-to"" restaurants for tourists (specifically the location and if possible the timing of visit to avoid the crowd)

stinky tofu -> i assume there are many places that sell it, but where should i go?  
night market -> do you have a specific stall that you think worth trying?

The kind of place that you will bring your friends and family to when they visit Taiwan.



I know that this question has been asked multiple times, i did look into the subreddit rules and i hope i do not break any:

* i did look into the wiki - food section -> not up to date(?)
* searched 'food' through this subreddit -> there are a lot of good recommendations, but mostly is about the 'what', not the location
* saw the weekly thread and found 'Generic questions that most likely won't generate discussion as their own thread.' -> i hope this thread will generate some discussion(?)

How taiwanese see domestic violence,1gj2sn3,"I was curious about how domestic violence is seen in Taiwan. I stopped living with my parents at age 6, but I remember my father would beat my mother pretty often. I think my other family members knew, they didn't think it was a good thing but they didn't demand he stopped either. I think some of them kind of were ok with it. I'm curious, is that considered common in Taiwan or is it seen at something not good. He beat her a lot, and it was pretty violent, I saw some of it when I was 5 years old. I was adopted and I can't tell if something is/was wrong with my parents, or they were just common Taiwanese from previous generations.

"TECO Atlanta wont pick up the phone, less than 30 days before i leave",1gjp3yh,"Good afternoon everyone. I married a Taiwanese woman this time last year, and i am moving to Taiwan to be with her. We have been making preparations, applying to schools, getting documents ready, selling stuff, all that awesome stuff. The only issue now is that TECO Atlanta has gone MIA, and there are 2 documents that they told me i needed only 2 weeks ago. I’m set to leave on November 28th, so naturally im shitting bricks. 

We have been in regular touch since august. I dont know if they confused which visa i am pursuing (visitors for relatives to be turned into ARC), but the lady was so rude! I dont have a car because it was totaled 3 months before leaving. Didnt seem wise to buy another one, so i tell her i will need to find a way to get to the office (i am 1.5 hours away by car) and she tells me its none of her business which shocked me. 

She made comments about how nobody has ever asked these many questions (6 questions in bullet points) and how started talking down to me saying things like “is this really that hard for you?” “Can you do it yourself? I have emails to get back to…”. She would cut me off before i could tell her why i called and ask me questions that will eventually deduce what i was trying to ask from the get go, and once again “oh thats it? Why didnt you just say so, thats so simple”

Im sure she was busy, but i was cordial!! How she treated me was unnecessary, i wanted to have a good relations with them after all. There was no warning for it either. Idk what im going to do about this visa thing. Thanks for listening to my 5 minute rant.

Master’s degree at NTU vs europe,1gj8627,"I’m graduating with a bachelor’s in engineering and weighing whether to continue at my own school in Finland (Decently well recognised and ranked engineering university, top 150-200) vs applying to NTU. I’m looking specifically at the master’s programme in semiconductor technology at the graduate school of advanced technology.

I did an exchange period at NTUST and really miss the studying life in Taipei. After my undergrad I’ve decided that the semiconductor industry is where I want to focus on. The industry is growing all over the world, including Finland where I’m from. I also have a lot of friends in Taiwan and generally wouldn’t mind working here at least while I’m young and don’t have kids. My mandarin is currently at TOCFL B level, and I can keep up quite well with conversation in mandarin only in a friend group. I imagine NTU would have the best semiconductor industry connections of almost any university, so with all the above factors, NTU is looking very tempting. However, I’m also aware of the downsides (asian degrees might not be as well recognized globally, and obviously Taiwan has much worse work culture)

Is it better to finish my degree quickly at home and then apply for jobs in Taiwan, or should I jump ship and do a master’s at NTU? Any advice is appreciated!",1730702267.0,12

Best (or favorite) Enka songs? (臺語演歌),1gitb0p,"If you don’t know Enka, you might have still heard it—maybe on a taxi radio or echoing from a karaoke tent in the mountains. Here is an introduction:

>Enka originates from Japan and has been popularized in Taiwan in the 60's and 70's, in songs of nostalgic feelings, a certain longing for the ""lost home"" (hint: *the mainland*), or shared identity through love and companionship. Here is [one example](https://youtu.be/yp3jvxW-LyM), released in 1992.

Since the most popular Taiwanese Enka songs are in Hokkien (臺語 / Táiyǔ), I would argue that Enka also served as a refuge for expressing and celebrating the Taiwanese language during an era when it was politically marginalized under pre-1987 (end of martial law) KMT rule.

If you know Taiwanese Enka very well, do you have any favorite tracks or authentic recordings? I’m especially interested in good-quality recordings (no tacky TV stage performances, if possible) that really capture the artistic side of this genre. Feel free to share any playlists, albums, or even recommendations for live Enka performances in Taiwan.

Parental Pressure Advice for a Bystander,1gj313p,"I am one of those old foreign dudes that still plays with a skateboard (its great physical exercise and fun). I'm seeking some cultural advice from the wise redditors of r/Taiwan.    
  
Its no surprise that in Taiwan parents put a high amount of pressure on kids in education and sports. However there is this issue that I keep seeing over and over in the skate parks here. Kids will be too scared to perform a trick but there parents will put so much pressure on them that kids often leave the skatepark in tears. Let me explain a specific situation that happened.

The other day I was at the skatepark and notice a kid maybe 8 years old trying to learn to drop into the ramp for the first time. This is a very scary thing the first time you learn how to do this. I've seen first hand kids break wrist or ankles doing this. It takes lots of confidence and being comfortable in your own skill.

I notice he was really struggling to work up the courage to do it. After watching him for 15-30mins just standing on the top of the ramp asked him in Chinese if he wanted help and offered to hold his hand to help him go down the ramp for the first time. The child declined the big scary bearded man's help, understandable. 

After about another 30-60mins of this. His dad came over and just started assaulting him with pressure. Saying stuff like ""Why are you standing here for so long, why did we even come? Stop being a coward...blah blah blah"" The kid was in tears as the dad was pressuring him to go down the ramp. The kid kept trying to build up the courage to go down but backed down every time, which caused the dad to assault him with more words. Honestly I couldn't understand everything he was saying or hear him very well the whole time.

My Taiwanese friend, who we mostly talk in Chinese switches to English and starts talking to me about the situation to avoid the dad understanding. Another Taiwanese jumps in and is like ""This is how some Taiwanese parents are, its not good."" 

Skateboarding culture is generally about pushing yourself and trying to push self compare your own skill with yourself verses competing with others (though there is a space for this). 

I didn't do anything to intervene in the situation cause I didn't want to make this worse for the kid. But I had an itch to just say to the dad ""Why don't you show him how to do it first."" Very well knowing the dude probably can't even ride on a skateboard. Or even trying to have a sloppy conversation in Chinese about ""Don't put so much pressure on him. I was 12 before I did this for the first time. The kid has time and the pressure will just make him more scared. Let him push himself when he is ready.""

Or trying to just privately go over and encourage the kid and tell him he's doing alright. but the dad never left his side the rest of the time I was there. He just towered over his kid trying to force him do the trick.

But I never said anything and it drives me crazy. I know this is a foreigner problem to some degree. But they are in the skatepark which is my culture. Skateboarding is a culture that expands the world with small variants. 

I'm looking for advice for what to do in these situations, it sadly happens a lot in Taiwan. I've never seen so many kids crying while at a skatepark. Image seeing someone crying while doing down a waterslide, like what?! Like just image if a kid was too afraid to go into a baseball batting cage and the dad was like forcing the kid to do to the point of tears or forcing a kid to be a Football goalie but didn't want to get hit in the face with balls (just trying to make this situation more relatable).  
  
Should I just ignore it? Is there a way to intervene in a way to make the situation better for the kid or help the dad to take a step back? What would you do in this situation?",1730684041.0,1
Where to buy hair products?,1gj1xm4,"I know this might be silly, but I’m definitely unsure where to buy hair conditioner specifically.

University Grad/Masters Admissions at Taiwan Universities ,1gittjc,"您好 r/taiwan !

Although I have yet to finish my studies and decide a career path (and gain a bit of work experience too), I was wondering (with a bit of daydreaming/what-if sparkled on top) how difficult would be for me to get admitted into a masters in Taiwan(namely NTU, National Tsing Hua, NTUST... ), since from what I saw online, their admissions rates seems to be relatively high (hovering between 30-50%), for the reputation they hold.

For a bit of background info: I'm a computer engineering undergrad student with a 7.7(not bad but not perfect either) average on the Spanish grading system (a 5 is the passing grade and roughly equivalent to a 60%), and planning to get a few undergrad research and normal internships to get a grasp of what I want to do after I finish my degree. As for languages, I currently possess an English level of 203 (Cambridge CAE), a few dabbles in French and Esperanto, and I'm planning to study Chinese over the summer holidays.

Regarding why Taiwan, setting aside the relevancy it has on my sector, after an exchange semester at Shih Chien University, I fell in love with the food and culture(and the Taipei metro!), and to be honest I wouldn't mind spending a few years in living and studying in Taiwan.

Taiwanese people are the most rude hostile people I’ve ever met in my life and Taiwan is much worse than other countries in Asia.,1gjemct,"Having just had yet another rude hostile interaction with a Taiwanese, this time in family mart, I now feel so fed up with Taiwan and the Taiwanese and want to leave ASAP. This woman at family mart literally shouted at me for daring to ask for syrup in my coffee. She shouted at me in Chinese in front of some other customers and I was so embarrassed and I had no idea what she was saying.

On Friday I made a post detailing how I felt Taiwan wasn’t what a lot of people on this sub make it out to be and now I want to give a follow up with some further points for the benefit of people in the rest of the world who may be considering Taiwan as a place to live.

Let’s start with the “Taiwanese are so friendly” nonsense

Since coming here I’ve had to deal with so many hostile people, with several Interactions a week like the one I mentioned that happened to me today. Everyone looks at you like you’re an alien. Parents pull their children away from you. You walk into a restaurant and the staff try to ignore you. In my condo people are so unfriendly they will wait for another lift rather than getting into the same lift as someone else. My hotel I stayed at when I first got here, the staff tried to get everyone using a self-check in because they didn’t want to have to interact with anyone. Service staff would rather blame you than accepting their mistakes. The whole culture feels incredible rude and hostile.

I would advise anyone coming here to not expect to make a single Taiwanese friend, they don’t want to be friends. They don’t even get on well with each other, if you str and look at the people walking on the road or in a ma they will all have grumpy hostile face expressions. Groups of people walk together but they don’t talk or laugh with each other, they would rather just walk silently. Same in a restaurant, restaurants are often very quiet because nobody is talking to each other, they all just eat and look at their phones.

I would also advise anyone coming here that any potentially friendly interaction you have with a Taiwanese will be immensely fake and they will be hoping you leave them and go away as soon as possible or give them something (money).

I don’t mind this since I’m only here temporarily and I came with some other foreign friends but it would be very tough if you’re planning to move here long term.

Some other things which I really hate about Taiwan that never gets mentioned on this sub.

1. The public toilets. This supposedly developed modern country still has disgusting squat toilets all over the place. No modern country has these. Most supposedly poorer countries in south east Asia now have sit down toilets with bum gun as standard, Japan and Korea have bidet toilets as standard. Taiwan is terribly far behind with this.

2. Together with the squat toilets you will see bins full of disgusting soiled toilet paper. This is totally unnecessary and disgusting. I’ve never seen this anywhere else and it makes me hate Taiwan everytime I see it.

3. The weather here is consistently awful. Summer is so unbearably hot you can’t even go outside at night without sweating (this is different to SE Asia where temperature cools down significantly at night). Mos days are horribly grey, rainy and overcast. I’ve counted 18 rainy days in a row since I came here as well as 2 typhoons. You’ll be forced to spend a lot of time indoors if you come to Taiwan.

4. The night markets. I can’t believe these are actual tourist attractions. They are hot, crowded and dirty with nowhere to sit. Go to Thailand if you want night markets. In Thailand every stand has ample seats and tables around it to sit and eat. As well as lots of clothes and accessory shops thrown in and concert stages for live bands to perform on (it’s really fun). You certainly won’t get that in Taiwan.

5. The garbage collection. Fortunately I don’t have to deal with this nonsense where I live. But the whole garbage collection situation is so ridiculous and unnecessary. The fact anyone can describe Taiwan as a convenient country when they have this system blows my mind.

6. Things take ages to repair when broken. One of The elevators broke in my building and wasn’t repaired for about two weeks, everywhere else I’ve lived this would be fixed in a day or 2 max. Not to mention the fact places are constantly turning off the elevators “to save electricity” forcing everyone to wait longer.

7. Constant sewage smell everywhere. When you’re walking just outside 101 mall you don’t expect to be breathing in sewage. Enough said.

8. Terrible tourist infrastructure. It’s embarrassing when people come to visit me and I have to recommend such a bad selection of hotels for them to stay at. Not to mention the fact all the beaches here are totally undeveloped with no beach resorts, beach clubs etc like other countries. A lot of beaches here are covered in garbage.

9. Bad breath everywhere. I’ve never come across so many otherwise perfectly respectable people who otherwise have terrible breath as in Taiwan. Especially in the morning. It is so disgusting and I don’t know why it’s so bad here. 


I'm posting this to give some balance to this incredibly delusion sub. We had someone yesterday asking something about the paper towels in restaurants and phrasing their question ""I love taiwan but ......?, I love Taiwan so much"" like seriously just ask your question.

Influencer gold cards,1gj1o0f,"Hi Taiwan friends! I did a working holiday in Taiwan a few years ago and fell in love with Taiwan and would love to move back.

Does anyone know if social media influencers or YouTubers get gold cards? What category do they fall under? That's an option I can work on building to get an ARC eventually as I have 12k followers on tiktok right now. I was offered some money to make some videos for a government project while I was in Taiwan but I had already booked my flight home so I missed it. I did wonder if I went back on a tourist visa and made similar videos I might be able to get a gold card as a journalist eventually perhaps.

"Selling a house in Taiwan, real estate agency says we are liable for repairs for 5 years after completion??",1ghr9cb,"TLDR: Sold a house in Taipei, typhoons messed it up, real estate agency says we are liable for repairs **for 5 years** after selling the house. Is this true?

Longer:
Hello, my wife's father is a Taiwanese citizen and he moved to North America around 20 years ago. When his mom died, he inherited her house in Taipei and kept renting it to the original tenants.     

Now, he fell sick a few years ago and my wife decided to sell the old house in Taipei so that he can have some money to retire. My wife and I live in Europe, so we have been going through a real estate agency in Taipei for the sale of the house.

Before the sale, the agency hired a bunch of contractors to fix things up: leaky pipes, leaky windows (lots of leaky stuff in Taipei apparently), moldy walls etc. We have paid an insane amount of money before even selling the house.

Now the house is technically sold, but there has been one of the worst typhoon seasons ever in Taiwan, so apparently things have started to leak again. The real estate agency keeps sending us bills for the repairs, even tho we do not own the house anymore, and they said that we are liable for this **for another 5 years**.

Can anyone here confirm? We fixed up a house, sold it, and now every typhoon season we are gonna have to spend tens of thousands to fix someone else's property while they get the rent money?? I am afraid we are getting scammed.

Thanks for everyone that can shed a light on it, I'm useless as I cannot read chinese and my wife's reading level is not enough for legal documents since she was raised in North America.

**中古屋瑕疵擔保責任消滅時效是 5 年**    
根據《民法》第 356 條和第 365 條規定，買方有義務在交屋後確認房屋是否有瑕疵，若有發現任何瑕疵應通知賣方，若賣方不處理，就要在通知賣方後 6 個月內向法院提起訴訟。《民法》第 356 條同時也說明了，買房的瑕疵擔保請求權在交屋後 5 年就會消滅，也就是說，《民法》保障買方可以在交屋內 5 年提出瑕疵擔保請求權。    

**中古屋保固期限習慣上以半年為限**    
然而，在中古屋買賣交易時，實務上會以 6 個月為限，因為買方如果要行使瑕疵擔保的請求權，必須提出證據，證明瑕疵是發生在交屋之前。以漏水的問題作為例子，買方如果要證明漏水是發生在交屋之前，通常會需要請專業的驗屋公司來進行驗屋，提出客觀的數據來證明。時間越久，買方自然會越難提出證據，因此，中古屋保固期限一般會是半年。",1730532733.0,32

My experience driving at Taroko National Park after April Earthquake ,1gh5nor,"Three weeks ago, in early October, I was wondering if I can go through Taroko National Park because of the earthquake in April. I haven't seen any info online, so I'm sharing my knowledge and footage here. 

Currently the park is closed, but you can go driving through it from Guanyuan to Hualien (or the other way). You need to check that the roads are open, check the National Park website. You have three different parts and each part have different opening times to go through, so you need to calculate what time you need to go and what time you need to stop.

\*If it says only ""10:00"", it means that if you will be late in 20 minutes, it will be closed - you must be early.

When I did it, I did took a lot of stops in the park and did a small hike even though it's not accepted, nobody will stop you or check you. Iv'e made a lot of stops in the road no problem with it. I talked with the visior center and they think it will take two years to recover all the trails. The park has changed a lot, but nature is still amazing!

Please note: it can be dangerous, if you go, do it with caution!

Any of you teach at or have kids going to “bilingual” schools? How the heck are things being fit into the curriculum?,1gh5knn,"I’m just a clueless boob interested in how 1–12 schooling is done
here nowadays compared to my days (almost two decades ago)
and this question is part of that overarching theme.
Forgive me for any gross misunderstanding.
In Taichung there are several private “bilingual” schools
like Korrnell Ritz (Taichung doesn’t have public ones yet)
but all of these are surprisingly tight‐lipped about
how they run things to the general public.
My understanding is that to be a “bilingual” school
basically every subject is taught in both Chinese and English.
Doesn’t that inflate class time quite a bit,
as you’d have to teach everything twice, give out two tests etc.?
Do kids also get basically twice the amount of homework
compared to at a “monolingual” school?
Are they nowadays just expected to spend even more time on schoolwork
or are some topics omitted from a “monolingual” curriculum to make it bilingual?

Furthermore a few of those schools claim to have a “dual‐track” curriculum (雙軌課綱)
so like they offer a domestic one and a foreign one usually American.
My understanding is because these schools are advertised as “bilingual”
and not “international” schools,
students are learning *two* countries’ worth of K12 material.
So like are students learning U.S. history and government in addition to ROC civics?
How in the world does all that extra stuff fit into their curriculum and class schedules?

Taiwan is not what people make it out to be - Be Warned! ,1gh51z4,"Having lived here for 3 months, I feel I have to challenge some of the excessive praise I see for Taiwan on this community and elsewhere. 

Having previously lived in Thailand, I’m bitterly disappointed with Taiwan. I came here expecting  a very developed modern country, with friendly people and tasty food and everything being super convenient. Well that is not what I have experienced.


Take “the Taiwanese people are so friendly”
I feel like the Taiwanese are the most hostile people I’ve ever come across in my life. I’ve had far more friendly interactions with people from every other country I’ve visited or lived in.


Some examples

I was trying on clothes at a shop and they didn’t fit so tried to hand them back to the staff member who was at the changing rooms. She just pointed and said “table”. Like wtf? In pretty much the rest of the world, they would said “oh please put it on the table” or just take it from you. 

I wanted a bag at 7-eleven and asked for a bag, here you can get small 2ntd bags and big 5ntd bags. The woman gave me the big one when I only had 3 things so I gently told her a small bag is fine. She literally snatched the bag and shoved a smaller one at me really aggressively. 

I had to pay for something at a hospital here and when I handed the money over, the woman took it without looking at me or saying a word. In most countries people would say thanks. In most Asian countries even, people bow slightly when taking money from a customer. I was quite shocked. 

I genuinely don’t understand where the “Taiwanese are so friendly” mantra comes from because I haven’t experienced it at all. Everyone walks around with a grumpy face all the time. In my building people don’t even get in the lift together if they can avoid it. Compare this to Americans, Thais, Malaysians, Italians even British and their warmth and friendliness is so much more than Taiwanese. 


Second myth is “Taiwanese food is so good”
I genuinely don’t know what people who say this used to be eating. 
What do you think tastes so nice?
Beef noodles? Oily and bland
Xiao long bao? They taste alright but nothing special
Dan bing? Any omelette in Europe is better
Deep fried rice ball? It made me want to throw up 
Pot stickers? Smells gross
Bubble tea? The bubbles are gross
And then if you want any foreign food here, it tastes horrible and it’s massively overpriced and “Taiwanfied”
Most of the local Taiwanese restaurants are pretty horrible places as well with bland walls and small stools to sit on


“Taiwan is so convenient” hahahah no

It’s not convenient not being given a precise appointment time at hospital but rather a vague 13:00-16:00.
It’s not convenient that food panda and Uber eats are mostly in Chinese
It’s not convenient that convenience stores don’t have medicine and only have 1 or 2 people working in them leaving you to queue for a long time to pay. 
It’s not convenient that I have to order by putting crosses on a piece of paper (again in Chinese) rather than being asked by a waiter/waitress. Some “restaurants” even then ask you to clear your own table! 
It’s not convenient that most restaurants are closed 14:00-17:00… what if I want to eat then
Sorry but Taiwan is not convenient. 

“Modern developed country” okay no

5 minutes driving from Taoyuan airport to the city will put that myth to bed. Most of the buildings look like Soviet mass housing. Utterly hideous and no where near on Singapore, Japan or Hong Kong’s level. When I walk down my street (which is in Xinyi, a supposedly high end area) I have a constant stench of sewage together with a lack of pavements (sidewalks). And there is a huge lack of housing. Thai middle class live in condos with rooftop pools, gyms and free parking. Taiwanese middle class live somewhere where they are luckily to have their own kitchen.  The malls here are also so boring. They are literally all the same. If you’re familiar with Bangkok’s incredible mall scene you’ll be very disappointed with Taipei. 

I can’t wait to leave this miserable place and it’s grumpy hostile people behind. 



EDIT: The responses here have been very insightful. I think the people who defend and praise Taiwan are the most fragile people I’ve ever come across, it’s like they know the place they promote is flawed and can’t bare when it gets pointed out to them. It feels like PRC levels of fragility. I highly doubt such a vindictive response would happen if I were to make a post about most other countries. 

Quite a few responses are actually agreeing with me though, which I wasn’t expecting given this is the Taiwan sub and suggests I’m not the only one to feel like this.

Where is the money coming from?,1geuti7,"I’ve been living in Tainan for the past month and have been surprised by the amount of money I’ve seen, or at least the appearance of wealth. Riding around on the back of my friends’ scooter, I see a lot of brand new german luxury cars, teslas and Lexuses on the street. There’s fancy new high rises being built - I checked the prices out of curiosity and the cost of buying even a small apartment is quite shocking, even with the knowledge that housing price is an issue here. All of this is surprising me especially when hearing how much my friends make and the average income, which is relatively much lower. 

Who is occupying these apartments and driving the luxury cars? Obviously, the semiconductor industry is a huge source of revenue - is it all electrical engineers and fab technicians? I somehow doubt that. Is the money then mainly flowing to landlords/property investors/builders? I expected to see this kind of wealth in downtown Taipei, but seeing it in a relatively smaller town was surprising.

Applying for Taiwan Passport and Household Registration and Conscription Overseas Exemption,1gg1i56,"Hi All,

So just a little background. I was born in the US to Taiwanese parents and have never had a Taiwanese Passport or Household registration. I've been looking to get move forward with applying for citizenship through my parents, but have avoided it since there was a years residency requirement, the military service requirement and I couldn't step away from the US that long, until they did away with the required stay. I've gotten the basic process of getting my passport and household registration along with the required documents. 

My question is related closer to military service requirement and being exempt due to living overseas. I know I can apply for an Overseas ID for Military Service Purposes, but wanted to know what the proper way or sequence this should all be done. I know I should get my passport before going to Taiwan to get my household registration, but what about obtaining an overseas status. Does it apply to me as someone who's lived in the US his entire life, but will only have recently gotten his citizenship. And as I need the household registration to apply for the overseas status, will I be conscripted the moment I receive my household registration?
