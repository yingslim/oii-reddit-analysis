Trump Presidency Predictions for China,1gkv0cg,"Now that Trump has won the presidency, here are a few predictions. 

1. Tariffs: About 50% of Amazon's Top 10,000 stores come from China. Amazon products, especially off label products for the US will become more expensive and many of the Chinese stores will not be as competitive, so it might be a good idea to start a store, source from China, but ship from Vietnam with component plus. (99% finished good, shipped to Vietnam, add a small component and say made in Vietnam). 

2. H1B's from China will only be allowed on an extreme case by case basis. Expect fewer Chinese graduates staying in the US. 

3. Trump will isolate the US, so Ukraine is toast. Expect China to take a greater role in the world, especially in Asia, Africa and perhaps Europe, while the US focuses on improving it's domestic economy and policies. 

4. Expect Chinese EV's in the US perhaps even over German cars if they are manufactured in the US. With tariffs both on China and European cars, Chinese EVs can go to Trump and tell him they'll build manufacturing in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.

5. Expect less rhetoric about Xinjiang or Hong Kong rights, but more about the economy. 

6. Expect more restrictions on Chinese tech in the US although. Tik Tok could go either way as Musk is probably anti Tik Tok. Wechat might be in trouble. 

7. Expect more Anti China rhetoric in areas where US is not doing well. The China initiative is likely to start back again. 

8. Taiwan is probably in a more precarious situation and could be used as an economic bargaining tool. 

So some good for China, some bad. not sure where the net is. ",1730886914.0,155,MichaelLee518,hd_marketing,MichaelLee518,1730889247.0,62,POLITICAL

1. Tariffs: About 50% of Amazon's Top 10,000 stores come from China. Amazon products, especially off label products for the US will become more expensive and many of the Chinese stores will not be as competitive, so it might be a good idea to start a store, source from China, but ship from Vietnam with component plus. (99% finished good, shipped to Vietnam, add a small component and say made in Vietnam). 

2. H1B's from China will only be allowed on an extreme case by case basis. Expect fewer Chinese graduates staying in the US. 

3. Trump will isolate the US, so Ukraine is toast. Expect China to take a greater role in the world, especially in Asia, Africa and perhaps Europe, while the US focuses on improving it's domestic economy and policies. 

4. Expect Chinese EV's in the US perhaps even over German cars if they are manufactured in the US. With tariffs both on China and European cars, Chinese EVs can go to Trump and tell him they'll build manufacturing in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.

5. Expect less rhetoric about Xinjiang or Hong Kong rights, but more about the economy. 

6. Expect more restrictions on Chinese tech in the US although. Tik Tok could go either way as Musk is probably anti Tik Tok. Wechat might be in trouble. 

7. Expect more Anti China rhetoric in areas where US is not doing well. The China initiative is likely to start back again.

"Chinese single women today, won’t marry anyone that doesn’t has luxury car and house at the city? But also don’t want to be called to do any domestic works?",1gkdc4s,"What I’ve heard is that they don’t want to keep the tradition thinking that the women have to take care of the home and do the domestic works and take care of the children while their husband is outside working and making money for them 

But they also want to keep the part of that tradition that thinks that the men have to work and make money to care of the whole family all of him alone.

So what I get is that they want to marry a rich man that keeps the tradition of taking care of the whole family economically but they don’t want to do their women part in taking care of the domestic works on the house and the children.. they just want to enjoy and enjoy

And they say that is the way the men should show their love to them, but then, what should be the way how women show their love to men? If that love truly exist

My Experience Flying General Aviation in China,1gkqfqv,"During the previous October holiday, I met with a friend who has a flight school and having a private license myself from the UK, we decided to go flying together over a couple of days and make a couple of videos with go-pros to keep as a memory of the experience. We also talked about the process of converting my UK license to a Chinese one so I could go up more and take friends etc. This is what my friend did and so he is familiar with it all.

After we made the videos, he posted a few on his company's social media channels in promotional material (as they do in China) and it turns out the other day he got a call from the higher ups in government telling him that foreigners aren't permitted to fly in general aviation in China and to deleted any records of me flying on his social media and online. He also contacted me to do the same so I complied without much hesitation or questioning (as you know, you can't question the government here). He is also a trustworthy friend of mine. I'm not entirely sure what happened and what was said in his conversation but I was suddenly contacted to delete any record that I have too. 

I searched online for more details about foreigners flying light aircraft and helicopters in China and everything is very vague. The Chinese private license (PPL) requirements seem to state no limit regarding citizenship but just has a Mandarin ability requirement and through a respective test which I could pass easily. So I am not sure where this 'foreigners not permitted' rule comes from exactly. But this is China and I have heard from commercial pilots that they are not permitted to fly to any airport below any tier 1 without a Chinese citizen accompanying them and with special permission. There isn't any clear rule about GA that I could find. But this is China anyway and it is believable they would have such rules. Could be some official wants to be more safe than sorry kind of thing that is common in China. A little disappointed to say the least since it is something I liked doing back in the UK but have no way to keep my licence up to date anymore without having to go to any other country in the world.

If anyone has any more information about the laws regarding this situation, please chime in! Just wanted to share my own experience. ",1730868196.0,4,UsernameNotTakenX,AutoModerator,UsernameNotTakenX,1730868196.0,3,POLITICAL

Tips for making Chinese friends?,1gjzvj1,"I'm Vietnamese American (dual national), first gen / 1.5 gen immigrant, spent my formational years in both Vietnam and the US.

Chinese real estate investment abroad,1gk6145,"Hi all,

I want to start off by saying I don't mean to be insensitive in anyway. I came to ask myself this question after looking into the now (in)famous supertall skyscrapers in NYC, of which the Steinway Tower is probably the most notorious example. It is frequently said that these sorts of buildings are largely vacant, being instead held as an investment by mostly Chinese millionaires. As it happens, complaints about the effects of Chinese real estate investment have been commonplace in many cities across Europe and North America in recent years, most notably in Vancouver.

What I'm curious about is the following: who exactly are those super-wealthy Chinese who can afford to do this? I've met plenty of Chinese students in Europe and elsewhere, and some of them had quite a bit of money to spend. But even those guys didn't seem to be anything more than middle class by Western standards.

So who's doing this large-scale real estate investment? They can't all be CEOs, right?",1730811396.0,0,Complete_Patience244,Able-Worldliness8189,Complete_Patience244,1730869051.0,2,OTHER

15-day visa free experience on german passport,1gj61uc,"Went to china on a german passport using the 15 day visa free policy.

Before boarding in switzerland the airline did a sort or passport ""pre check"" to make sure you actually have a chance of getting entry into china. There i was asked to show a return flight.

After landing in Shanghai we exited the plane and went to straight to the entry area. Collect your fingerprints at one of the machines (machines had instructions in perfect english) then we were given blue landing cards to fill in. 
Going to immigration there was an officer checking the blue cards, he told you if you did something wrong or missed something. He asked me to add my phone number.

Actual immigration desk asked no further questions. I had to give my passport, the blue card and the fingerprint ticket. They took a photo, checked fingerprints again and then looked through my passport and stamped it. Everything took about 10 minutes total.
No hotel bookings or flight tickets were asked. 

Same with customs. Just put your bag through the scanner and they did not say anything and then we were in.

I just wanted to share this so you wont feel as anxious as i did. Honestly this was super easy and quick. ",1730693954.0,67,Lolwis,kenny32vr,Lolwis,1730716978.0,14,OTHER

What’s going on with this sub and r/Chinalife? I remember it was similar to this sub before but with more locals also active.,1gj8j1i,"But recently Ive noticed heavy brigading from r/sino on basically all China subreddits and also world news and anime titties with almost their entire account history trying to debunk facts and opinions about China and deflecting to issues in western society. It’s got to the point where every other post on r/Chinalife is about how bad r/china is and how none of us live in China and we’re all racist idiots. Is the plan to just overwhelm the platform with posts and comments to influence the subreddits this way?

"""can I wear a T-Shirt mocking communism in China?""",1gk4290,"recently I've come across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1gi0aud/can_i_wear_this_tshirt_to_china/) asking if it's OK to do so, I didn't pay too much attention to it, and mocking communism is actually fun to me. but many comments suggested him to be cautious, which reminded me that because of the stricter social control, it could indeed be problematic. Still, I wans't too interested in discussing about it.

What triggered me is that just now in Guangdong, I met a foreigner carring a bag with the Rising Sun Flag(Japan Navy Flag) on it. I'm not ""Chinese nationalist"" who will go crazy about this flag, but will a tweaked Swastika be acceptable in Israel? probably won't, and I doubt any sane men will do so. But they find it OK to do so in China.

Germany basically cut off its bonds with Nazi after WW2, but Japan kinda got away and used a slightly modified imperial/fascist flag as its navy flag. anyway, there're only Chinese and Koreans yapping about it.

what's really interesting is that foreigners actually know what they shouldn't do in China, that is, don't mock the government, otherwise there would be real consequences. But towards Chinese people? it's fine to piss them off. why? because they don't have rights and the government doesn't care about them, well the gov actually cares a lot more about foreigners than its own citizens.

the bottom line is, it's a shame for Chinese that everyone else knows most Chinese are despised and their opinions don't matter. but the first one to blame is the CCP, who exploited Chinese people and sold them to foreigners.

it was, and it has been a shame that Chinese people are ruled by such a thief government.

The Chinese high school math prodigy Jiang ping (姜萍) story turned out to be a flop,1gii4sy,"tldr: Alibaba held annual math competition, in this year's 1st round, a high schooler named Jiang Ping(to be accurate, a 17 years old student from a secondary technical school) from a relatively undeveloped area, who study ""fashion design"" at school, placed a very high score on the board, beating students from top universities math major.

Suddenly, her story was all over China: a fashion major technical school student placed high rank on a math competition where top universities students are the usual contenders. She became the perfect math Cinderella story, not only beating top universities math major students, but also, being a female, in a male dominated competition. Praise followed by questions, as people wonder if her score was legit, and how she could compete in a math competition that required highly specialized math software and a personal computer, which she own neither. Against all the questions, Jiang Ping proceed to participate in the final round of the competition.

After almost half an year later, the official investigation from alibaba found out that her ""score was obtained illegally with the help of another individual"", but didn't specify who. Her school also released a notification punishing her math teacher who is possibly the one that actually participated under her name. Alibaba also post the final rank where Jiang Ping didn't score any place.

What they are teaching kids in China,1gi2r10,"Translated from a tweet

I saw a Japanese media report yesterday that Japanese schools in Shanghai, Shenzhen and other places in China decided to have a day off on December 13 this year. Because this day is the ""Nanjing Massacre Memorial Day"" designated by the Chinese government, large-scale commemorative activities will be held in Nanjing and other places. Television media will also criticize Japanese militarism in various forms.

Anti-Japanese sentiment is rising in China. Japanese schools, school administrators and parents everywhere are afraid that Japanese children will be attacked again. So we decided to have a holiday on December 13th.

Since June last year, incidents surrounding Japanese schools have occurred one after another. For example, in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, a Japanese mother and son were attacked and injured while waiting for a pick-up bus; and on September 18, in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, a boy was attending school. He was attacked and died on the way. As for these two incidents, China considers them to be ""accidental incidents"" and says they were not targeted at the Japanese. So far, no details of the case have been provided to Japan. As a result, many Japanese company employees working in China had no choice but to send their children back to Japan to study.

In Chinese schools, children are taught anti-Japanese hatred from an early age. Therefore, the Internet in China is full of messages such as ""I would rather have no grass growing in China, and we must recover the Diaoyu Islands"" and ""I would rather have graves everywhere in China, and we must kill all the Japanese."" ” and other extreme slogans.

In fact, it is not just Japanese children who are targeted in China. On October 28, a man stabbed people with a knife at the gate of Zhongguancun No. 3 Primary School, a famous elite primary school in Haidian District, Beijing, injuring five people, including three children.

In addition, there have been many attacks on primary school students recently, and the prisoners are basically middle-aged unemployed men. A Japanese reporter interviewed Beijing residents. Many interviewees explained that ""Nowadays, social pressure is high, living costs are high, and more and more people who cannot survive are going to extremes."" Regarding this answer, many Japanese media people expressed disbelief.

Because in 2021, the Chinese government held a national summary and commendation conference for poverty alleviation in Beijing. At the meeting, Xi Jinping solemnly announced to the world that all 98.99 million rural poor people under the current poverty line have been lifted out of poverty, creating a ""miracle on earth."" Why is it that just three years have passed and there are more and more poor people in China?",1730571550.0,268,Real-chocobo,Sensitive_Goose_8902,Real-chocobo,1730573204.0,57,POLITICAL

I saw a Japanese media report yesterday that Japanese schools in Shanghai, Shenzhen and other places in China decided to have a day off on December 13 this year. Because this day is the ""Nanjing Massacre Memorial Day"" designated by the Chinese government, large-scale commemorative activities will be held in Nanjing and other places. Television media will also criticize Japanese militarism in various forms.

Anti-Japanese sentiment is rising in China. Japanese schools, school administrators and parents everywhere are afraid that Japanese children will be attacked again. So we decided to have a holiday on December 13th.

Since June last year, incidents surrounding Japanese schools have occurred one after another. For example, in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, a Japanese mother and son were attacked and injured while waiting for a pick-up bus; and on September 18, in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, a boy was attending school. He was attacked and died on the way. As for these two incidents, China considers them to be ""accidental incidents"" and says they were not targeted at the Japanese. So far, no details of the case have been provided to Japan. As a result, many Japanese company employees working in China had no choice but to send their children back to Japan to study.

In Chinese schools, children are taught anti-Japanese hatred from an early age. Therefore, the Internet in China is full of messages such as ""I would rather have no grass growing in China, and we must recover the Diaoyu Islands"" and ""I would rather have graves everywhere in China, and we must kill all the Japanese."" ” and other extreme slogans.

In fact, it is not just Japanese children who are targeted in China. On October 28, a man stabbed people with a knife at the gate of Zhongguancun No. 3 Primary School, a famous elite primary school in Haidian District, Beijing, injuring five people, including three children.

In addition, there have been many attacks on primary school students recently, and the prisoners are basically middle-aged unemployed men. A Japanese reporter interviewed Beijing residents. Many interviewees explained that ""Nowadays, social pressure is high, living costs are high, and more and more people who cannot survive are going to extremes."" Regarding this answer, many Japanese media people expressed disbelief.

Because in 2021, the Chinese government held a national summary and commendation conference for poverty alleviation in Beijing. At the meeting, Xi Jinping solemnly announced to the world that all 98.99 million rural poor people under the current poverty line have been lifted out of poverty, creating a ""miracle on earth.""

So far, no details of the case have been provided to Japan. As a result, many Japanese company employees working in China had no choice but to send their children back to Japan to study.

In Chinese schools, children are taught anti-Japanese hatred from an early age. Therefore, the Internet in China is full of messages such as ""I would rather have no grass growing in China, and we must recover the Diaoyu Islands"" and ""I would rather have graves everywhere in China, and we must kill all the Japanese."" ” and other extreme slogans.

In fact, it is not just Japanese children who are targeted in China. On October 28, a man stabbed people with a knife at the gate of Zhongguancun No. 3 Primary School, a famous elite primary school in Haidian District, Beijing, injuring five people, including three children.

In addition, there have been many attacks on primary school students recently, and the prisoners are basically middle-aged unemployed men. A Japanese reporter interviewed Beijing residents. Many interviewees explained that ""Nowadays, social pressure is high, living costs are high, and more and more people who cannot survive are going to extremes."" Regarding this answer, many Japanese media people expressed disbelief.

Because in 2021, the Chinese government held a national summary and commendation conference for poverty alleviation in Beijing. At the meeting, Xi Jinping solemnly announced to the world that all 98.99 million rural poor people under the current poverty line have been lifted out of poverty, creating a ""miracle on earth.""

I saw a Japanese media report yesterday that Japanese schools in Shanghai, Shenzhen and other places in China decided to have a day off on December 13 this year. Because this day is the ""Nanjing Massacre Memorial Day"" designated by the Chinese government, large-scale commemorative activities will be held in Nanjing and other places. Television media will also criticize Japanese militarism in various forms.

Anti-Japanese sentiment is rising in China. Japanese schools, school administrators and parents everywhere are afraid that Japanese children will be attacked again. So we decided to have a holiday on December 13th.

Since June last year, incidents surrounding Japanese schools have occurred one after another. For example, in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, a Japanese mother and son were attacked and injured while waiting for a pick-up bus; and on September 18, in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, a boy was attending school.

I saw a Japanese media report yesterday that Japanese schools in Shanghai, Shenzhen and other places in China decided to have a day off on December 13 this year. Because this day is the ""Nanjing Massacre Memorial Day"" designated by the Chinese government, large-scale commemorative activities will be held in Nanjing and other places. Television media will also criticize Japanese militarism in various forms.

Anti-Japanese sentiment is rising in China. Japanese schools, school administrators and parents everywhere are afraid that Japanese children will be attacked again. So we decided to have a holiday on December 13th.

Since June last year, incidents surrounding Japanese schools have occurred one after another. For example, in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, a Japanese mother and son were attacked and injured while waiting for a pick-up bus; and on September 18, in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, a boy was attending school. He was attacked and died on the way. As for these two incidents, China considers them to be ""accidental incidents"" and says they were not targeted at the Japanese. So far, no details of the case have been provided to Japan. As a result, many Japanese company employees working in China had no choice but to send their children back to Japan to study.

In Chinese schools, children are taught anti-Japanese hatred from an early age. Therefore, the Internet in China is full of messages such as ""I would rather have no grass growing in China, and we must recover the Diaoyu Islands"" and ""I would rather have graves everywhere in China, and we must kill all the Japanese."" ” and other extreme slogans.

In fact, it is not just Japanese children who are targeted in China. On October 28, a man stabbed people with a knife at the gate of Zhongguancun No. 3 Primary School, a famous elite primary school in Haidian District, Beijing, injuring five people, including three children.

In addition, there have been many attacks on primary school students recently, and the prisoners are basically middle-aged unemployed men. A Japanese reporter interviewed Beijing residents. Many interviewees explained that ""Nowadays, social pressure is high, living costs are high, and more and more people who cannot survive are going to extremes.""

For example, in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, a Japanese mother and son were attacked and injured while waiting for a pick-up bus; and on September 18, in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, a boy was attending school. He was attacked and died on the way. As for these two incidents, China considers them to be ""accidental incidents"" and says they were not targeted at the Japanese. So far, no details of the case have been provided to Japan. As a result, many Japanese company employees working in China had no choice but to send their children back to Japan to study.

In Chinese schools, children are taught anti-Japanese hatred from an early age. Therefore, the Internet in China is full of messages such as ""I would rather have no grass growing in China, and we must recover the Diaoyu Islands"" and ""I would rather have graves everywhere in China, and we must kill all the Japanese."" ” and other extreme slogans.

In fact, it is not just Japanese children who are targeted in China. On October 28, a man stabbed people with a knife at the gate of Zhongguancun No. 3 Primary School, a famous elite primary school in Haidian District, Beijing, injuring five people, including three children.

In addition, there have been many attacks on primary school students recently, and the prisoners are basically middle-aged unemployed men. A Japanese reporter interviewed Beijing residents. Many interviewees explained that ""Nowadays, social pressure is high, living costs are high, and more and more people who cannot survive are going to extremes."" Regarding this answer, many Japanese media people expressed disbelief.

Because in 2021, the Chinese government held a national summary and commendation conference for poverty alleviation in Beijing. At the meeting, Xi Jinping solemnly announced to the world that all 98.99 million rural poor people under the current poverty line have been lifted out of poverty, creating a ""miracle on earth."" Why is it that just three years have passed and there are more and more poor people in China?",1730571550.0,268,Real-chocobo,Impressive-Bit6161,Real-chocobo,1730609133.0,-1,POLITICAL

I saw a Japanese media report yesterday that Japanese schools in Shanghai, Shenzhen and other places in China decided to have a day off on December 13 this year. Because this day is the ""Nanjing Massacre Memorial Day"" designated by the Chinese government, large-scale commemorative activities will be held in Nanjing and other places. Television media will also criticize Japanese militarism in various forms.

Transit Visa: the applicability to my imagined itinerary,1gj6d7y,"Hi, I'm Japanese and I feel a bit sad that the gov't of the CPC will obstinately not allow Japanese citizens' visa-free entry.

however, transit visa-free entry still remains available to Japanese people, and the requirement for its use is of course to use China's main cities as transfer point to third countries, and those permitted to enter can't go farther beyond the designated metropolitan area of each city.

Though aeroplanes are regarded as main manner to visit and leave China, I think it can meet the entry scheme's terms and conditions to use high speed rails to HK west kowloon, which is considered to be a ""departure from mainland jurisdiction"".

Have you ever tried this itinerary with that entry qualification?

I have a favor to ask,1giuks2,Back in 2019 I went on a trip to China and one of the place I went to was the Taihe Hall. I believe it was there when I bought a coin that represented the year of the pig and this year is the year of the dragon. I unfortunately have no plans of going back this year so I was hoping that someone could purchase it for me and I pay them to send it to me. ,1730661034.0,0,Chaoticam19,Routine-Dot8326,Chaoticam19,1730675279.0,1,CULTURAL

Language barrier is such a struggle for me to make friends with the local people.,1ghsv8p,"So i came to China a year ago to study Mandarin and I started almost from nothing. This year i joined university and i started to realize that i’m struggling so much to catch what my Chinese colleagues are talking about. There’s one day when i hung out with my Chinese band colleagues, they’re saying things back and forth while i just sit there trying to understand. I felt like an outsider and it makes me anxious since then.

I feel the worst especially when I hung out with my orchestra band colleagues. As a girl, girls are so much easier to talk to even though i don’t understand them too sometimes. However the guys are sooooooo much harder to approach. It feels like they have no interest in making friends, or even just talk with me (does it have anything to do with their socializing culture?). It’s not easy because the band are filled with mostly guys, so i always feel lonely and awkward on rehearsals 😭😭 they crack jokes but i can’t understand wth they just said 😭 i want band friends too…..🥲 

Chinese is my third language and to be honest it’s pretty bad :( I feel like i’m not me when i’m speaking Chinese, and i feel like i’m the driest person ever to talk to with because i can’t express myself in it. I became very bad with finding topics or hold a conversation, because my brain backflips constantly when i talk with them.

I want to be able to socialize with people and share humors with them just like when i’m speaking English (which is also not my first language). Does anyone have ever experienced this? Do you have any advice to give? Thanks!

edit: omg i forgot about this post, i’ve been so busy studying since my exams are incoming. thanks so much for the encouraging words, i’ll try to be more confident and optimistic!! soon i’m gonna make all of you proud ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ",1730540535.0,33,really-tired-pianist,malege2bi,really-tired-pianist,1730541512.0,19,CULTURAL

I feel the worst especially when I hung out with my orchestra band colleagues. As a girl, girls are so much easier to talk to even though i don’t understand them too sometimes.

It’s not easy because the band are filled with mostly guys, so i always feel lonely and awkward on rehearsals 😭😭 they crack jokes but i can’t understand wth they just said 😭 i want band friends too…..🥲 

Chinese is my third language and to be honest it’s pretty bad :( I feel like i’m not me when i’m speaking Chinese, and i feel like i’m the driest person ever to talk to with because i can’t express myself in it.

edit: omg i forgot about this post, i’ve been so busy studying since my exams are incoming. thanks so much for the encouraging words, i’ll try to be more confident and optimistic!! soon i’m gonna make all of you proud ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ",1730540535.0,33,really-tired-pianist,CT1107SEV,really-tired-pianist,1730745544.0,1,CULTURAL
Language barrier is such a struggle for me to make friends with the local people.,1ghsv8p,"So i came to China a year ago to study Mandarin and I started almost from nothing. This year i joined university and i started to realize that i’m struggling so much to catch what my Chinese colleagues are talking about. There’s one day when i hung out with my Chinese band colleagues, they’re saying things back and forth while i just sit there trying to understand. I felt like an outsider and it makes me anxious since then.

I feel the worst especially when I hung out with my orchestra band colleagues. As a girl, girls are so much easier to talk to even though i don’t understand them too sometimes. However the guys are sooooooo much harder to approach. It feels like they have no interest in making friends, or even just talk with me (does it have anything to do with their socializing culture?). It’s not easy because the band are filled with mostly guys, so i always feel lonely and awkward on rehearsals 😭😭 they crack jokes but i can’t understand wth they just said 😭 i want band friends too…..🥲 

Chinese is my third language and to be honest it’s pretty bad :( I feel like i’m not me when i’m speaking Chinese, and i feel like i’m the driest person ever to talk to with because i can’t express myself in it. I became very bad with finding topics or hold a conversation, because my brain backflips constantly when i talk with them.

My recent visit to China literally gave me a life-time PTSD,1ggsywx,"**Edit 3: I am very suprised that I had to tell many users who praised the healthcare of China that China has more cities apart from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The population of these 4 tier one cities is only 80 million in total, while China has 1.4 billion people. You cannot use your experience in the top 5% to demonstrate quality medical services in China.**

Edit 2: no, I am not affected by active users from r/China_irl or r/sino, beacause I knew who they are and what they are going to say. You cannot wake a person who is pretending to be asleep.

Edit: I fixed some grammar and spelling issues. It was hard to concentrate while writing such a story.

For the sake of the people still living in China, I'm not going to reveal many details, as anyone who is not naive knows that the CCP is very good at witch-hunting and has been shameless in this regard.

Recently, I visited China again after many years because a family member was dying. They had been diagnosed with a terminal disease several years ago, but all the doctors refused to help since then. The original words were like "" such a chronic condition wouldn't develop fast"". Well, guess it was not the case later.

*I somehow understood that Chinese doctors had their own reasons/concerns, such as avoiding the doctor-patient disputes, which are very common in China. Also, I hate to express it, but many Chinese doctors will try to persuade the patient's family to give up on terminal diseases, as ""it is wasting the money"". I am not going to talk about it too much here, as it needs a new post to make people understand how bad the situation could be.*

Back to the story, when I booked my trip in a hurry and eventually visited them, their condition was far worse than I had imagined. The affected body part was literally rotten, and it stank. Visitors had to wear masks; otherwise, it was hard not to throw up.

The patient also believed in some “witchcraft”- level remedies, and trying those only made their condition worse, considering doctors all could not do anything to help. It happened when a person was so desperate that they would seek every bit of opportunity for a cure. People who have not suffered from this cannot understand why they could do such irrational things - such kind of long-term diseases can easily destroy one's faith and common sense.

Did we try “terminal care”? Of course we did, but they were just connected to various tubes and asked to undergo a hundred irrelevant tests - the hospitals were trying to milk us for as much money as they could before the patient died. *The problem with these doctors were, they would not offer pain relief or qualify of life solutions either, because terminal care is probably too advanced/high-end in China still.* To make the matter worse, nobody in the family was an expert in the medical field.

Eventually, after several weeks of torture for everyone, including the patient, they passed away. The dying family member had begged us countless times to help them end their suffering, but how could we do that? Before their death, the unbearable pain even made them curse a family member who had been taking care of them for months! I couldn't believe my ears when I heard those harsh words.

Now you may think this was the end of the story, but the local government still wanted to complicate matters as much as they could. The deceased had made a coffin for their planned burial, but it had been banned months ago in their area. You needed to pay someone to remove it from the warehouse, and I don't want to repeat the horrendous process -

*An update here: the local government would collect all coffins at a low price, but you had to pay to have a coffin transported to their location. However, the local government was also selling coffins at double the price to nearby areas where burial was allowed. You can judge for yourself: was the local government doing this for the sake of land use?*

That was just one of the many miserable stories under China's ""moderately prosperous society in all respects,"" which is absolutely ridiculous propaganda. I bet for ordinary people, only those who are brainwashed by the CCP or have Stockholm Syndrome would praise it. I am not sure if foreigners can receive better quality medical care in China, but for civilians, having any critical disease is a nightmare for their whole family. We all understand that this (the healthcare system) is just the tip of the iceberg.

My entry to China wasn't pleasant either. I was asked a hundred questions about whom I was visiting, when, where, and why. My non-Chinese passport was examined so carefully, as if I were a spy. Oh, and of course, ten fingerprints had to be recorded for several rounds.

As a side note, during a formal dinner for a medical professional who once saved the life of another family member, it was beyond frustrating to hear them talk about how much gay people disgusted them and how little they could tolerate gay relationships. That said, when China wasn't called China, the hate against LGBT was not so fierce as today.

In the end, the necessary visit to China successfully planted a seed of various negative feelings in my mind, and I am still heartbroken while writing this post.",1730419970.0,575,Aidenfred,uniyk,Aidenfred,1730432089.0,129,POLITICAL

People who have not suffered from this cannot understand why they could do such irrational things - such kind of long-term diseases can easily destroy one's faith and common sense.

Did we try “terminal care”? Of course we did, but they were just connected to various tubes and asked to undergo a hundred irrelevant tests - the hospitals were trying to milk us for as much money as they could before the patient died. *The problem with these doctors were, they would not offer pain relief or qualify of life solutions either, because terminal care is probably too advanced/high-end in China still.* To make the matter worse, nobody in the family was an expert in the medical field.

Eventually, after several weeks of torture for everyone, including the patient, they passed away. The dying family member had begged us countless times to help them end their suffering, but how could we do that? Before their death, the unbearable pain even made them curse a family member who had been taking care of them for months! I couldn't believe my ears when I heard those harsh words.

Now you may think this was the end of the story, but the local government still wanted to complicate matters as much as they could. The deceased had made a coffin for their planned burial, but it had been banned months ago in their area. You needed to pay someone to remove it from the warehouse, and I don't want to repeat the horrendous process -

*An update here: the local government would collect all coffins at a low price, but you had to pay to have a coffin transported to their location. However, the local government was also selling coffins at double the price to nearby areas where burial was allowed. You can judge for yourself: was the local government doing this for the sake of land use?*

That was just one of the many miserable stories under China's ""moderately prosperous society in all respects,"" which is absolutely ridiculous propaganda. I bet for ordinary people, only those who are brainwashed by the CCP or have Stockholm Syndrome would praise it. I am not sure if foreigners can receive better quality medical care in China, but for civilians, having any critical disease is a nightmare for their whole family. We all understand that this (the healthcare system) is just the tip of the iceberg.

My entry to China wasn't pleasant either. I was asked a hundred questions about whom I was visiting, when, where, and why. My non-Chinese passport was examined so carefully, as if I were a spy. Oh, and of course, ten fingerprints had to be recorded for several rounds.

As a side note, during a formal dinner for a medical professional who once saved the life of another family member, it was beyond frustrating to hear them talk about how much gay people disgusted them and how little they could tolerate gay relationships. That said, when China wasn't called China, the hate against LGBT was not so fierce as today.

In the end, the necessary visit to China successfully planted a seed of various negative feelings in my mind, and I am still heartbroken while writing this post.",1730419970.0,575,Aidenfred,Dry_Perspective9905,Aidenfred,1730442705.0,46,POLITICAL

For the sake of the people still living in China, I'm not going to reveal many details, as anyone who is not naive knows that the CCP is very good at witch-hunting and has been shameless in this regard.

Recently, I visited China again after many years because a family member was dying. They had been diagnosed with a terminal disease several years ago, but all the doctors refused to help since then. The original words were like "" such a chronic condition wouldn't develop fast"". Well, guess it was not the case later.

*I somehow understood that Chinese doctors had their own reasons/concerns, such as avoiding the doctor-patient disputes, which are very common in China. Also, I hate to express it, but many Chinese doctors will try to persuade the patient's family to give up on terminal diseases, as ""it is wasting the money"". I am not going to talk about it too much here, as it needs a new post to make people understand how bad the situation could be.*

Back to the story, when I booked my trip in a hurry and eventually visited them, their condition was far worse than I had imagined. The affected body part was literally rotten, and it stank. Visitors had to wear masks; otherwise, it was hard not to throw up.

My recent visit to China literally gave me a life-time PTSD,1ggsywx,"**Edit 3: I am very suprised that I had to tell many users who praised the healthcare of China that China has more cities apart from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The population of these 4 tier one cities is only 80 million in total, while China has 1.4 billion people. You cannot use your experience in the top 5% to demonstrate quality medical services in China.**

Edit 2: no, I am not affected by active users from r/China_irl or r/sino, beacause I knew who they are and what they are going to say. You cannot wake a person who is pretending to be asleep.

Edit: I fixed some grammar and spelling issues. It was hard to concentrate while writing such a story.

For the sake of the people still living in China, I'm not going to reveal many details, as anyone who is not naive knows that the CCP is very good at witch-hunting and has been shameless in this regard.

Recently, I visited China again after many years because a family member was dying. They had been diagnosed with a terminal disease several years ago, but all the doctors refused to help since then. The original words were like "" such a chronic condition wouldn't develop fast"". Well, guess it was not the case later.

*I somehow understood that Chinese doctors had their own reasons/concerns, such as avoiding the doctor-patient disputes, which are very common in China. Also, I hate to express it, but many Chinese doctors will try to persuade the patient's family to give up on terminal diseases, as ""it is wasting the money"". I am not going to talk about it too much here, as it needs a new post to make people understand how bad the situation could be.*

Back to the story, when I booked my trip in a hurry and eventually visited them, their condition was far worse than I had imagined. The affected body part was literally rotten, and it stank. Visitors had to wear masks; otherwise, it was hard not to throw up.

The patient also believed in some “witchcraft”- level remedies, and trying those only made their condition worse, considering doctors all could not do anything to help. It happened when a person was so desperate that they would seek every bit of opportunity for a cure. People who have not suffered from this cannot understand why they could do such irrational things - such kind of long-term diseases can easily destroy one's faith and common sense.

Did we try “terminal care”? Of course we did, but they were just connected to various tubes and asked to undergo a hundred irrelevant tests - the hospitals were trying to milk us for as much money as they could before the patient died. *The problem with these doctors were, they would not offer pain relief or qualify of life solutions either, because terminal care is probably too advanced/high-end in China still.* To make the matter worse, nobody in the family was an expert in the medical field.

Eventually, after several weeks of torture for everyone, including the patient, they passed away. The dying family member had begged us countless times to help them end their suffering, but how could we do that? Before their death, the unbearable pain even made them curse a family member who had been taking care of them for months! I couldn't believe my ears when I heard those harsh words.

Now you may think this was the end of the story, but the local government still wanted to complicate matters as much as they could. The deceased had made a coffin for their planned burial, but it had been banned months ago in their area. You needed to pay someone to remove it from the warehouse, and I don't want to repeat the horrendous process -

*An update here: the local government would collect all coffins at a low price, but you had to pay to have a coffin transported to their location. However, the local government was also selling coffins at double the price to nearby areas where burial was allowed. You can judge for yourself: was the local government doing this for the sake of land use?*

That was just one of the many miserable stories under China's ""moderately prosperous society in all respects,"" which is absolutely ridiculous propaganda. I bet for ordinary people, only those who are brainwashed by the CCP or have Stockholm Syndrome would praise it. I am not sure if foreigners can receive better quality medical care in China, but for civilians, having any critical disease is a nightmare for their whole family. We all understand that this (the healthcare system) is just the tip of the iceberg.

My entry to China wasn't pleasant either. I was asked a hundred questions about whom I was visiting, when, where, and why. My non-Chinese passport was examined so carefully, as if I were a spy. Oh, and of course, ten fingerprints had to be recorded for several rounds.

As a side note, during a formal dinner for a medical professional who once saved the life of another family member, it was beyond frustrating to hear them talk about how much gay people disgusted them and how little they could tolerate gay relationships. That said, when China wasn't called China, the hate against LGBT was not so fierce as today.

The dying family member had begged us countless times to help them end their suffering, but how could we do that? Before their death, the unbearable pain even made them curse a family member who had been taking care of them for months! I couldn't believe my ears when I heard those harsh words.

Now you may think this was the end of the story, but the local government still wanted to complicate matters as much as they could. The deceased had made a coffin for their planned burial, but it had been banned months ago in their area. You needed to pay someone to remove it from the warehouse, and I don't want to repeat the horrendous process -

*An update here: the local government would collect all coffins at a low price, but you had to pay to have a coffin transported to their location. However, the local government was also selling coffins at double the price to nearby areas where burial was allowed. You can judge for yourself: was the local government doing this for the sake of land use?*

That was just one of the many miserable stories under China's ""moderately prosperous society in all respects,"" which is absolutely ridiculous propaganda. I bet for ordinary people, only those who are brainwashed by the CCP or have Stockholm Syndrome would praise it. I am not sure if foreigners can receive better quality medical care in China, but for civilians, having any critical disease is a nightmare for their whole family. We all understand that this (the healthcare system) is just the tip of the iceberg.

My entry to China wasn't pleasant either. I was asked a hundred questions about whom I was visiting, when, where, and why. My non-Chinese passport was examined so carefully, as if I were a spy. Oh, and of course, ten fingerprints had to be recorded for several rounds.

As a side note, during a formal dinner for a medical professional who once saved the life of another family member, it was beyond frustrating to hear them talk about how much gay people disgusted them and how little they could tolerate gay relationships. That said, when China wasn't called China, the hate against LGBT was not so fierce as today.

In the end, the necessary visit to China successfully planted a seed of various negative feelings in my mind, and I am still heartbroken while writing this post.",1730419970.0,575,Aidenfred,leerisu,Aidenfred,1730462618.0,4,POLITICAL
My recent visit to China literally gave me a life-time PTSD,1ggsywx,"**Edit 3: I am very suprised that I had to tell many users who praised the healthcare of China that China has more cities apart from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The population of these 4 tier one cities is only 80 million in total, while China has 1.4 billion people. You cannot use your experience in the top 5% to demonstrate quality medical services in China.**

Edit 2: no, I am not affected by active users from r/China_irl or r/sino, beacause I knew who they are and what they are going to say. You cannot wake a person who is pretending to be asleep.

Edit: I fixed some grammar and spelling issues. It was hard to concentrate while writing such a story.

For the sake of the people still living in China, I'm not going to reveal many details, as anyone who is not naive knows that the CCP is very good at witch-hunting and has been shameless in this regard.

Recently, I visited China again after many years because a family member was dying. They had been diagnosed with a terminal disease several years ago, but all the doctors refused to help since then. The original words were like "" such a chronic condition wouldn't develop fast"". Well, guess it was not the case later.

*I somehow understood that Chinese doctors had their own reasons/concerns, such as avoiding the doctor-patient disputes, which are very common in China. Also, I hate to express it, but many Chinese doctors will try to persuade the patient's family to give up on terminal diseases, as ""it is wasting the money"". I am not going to talk about it too much here, as it needs a new post to make people understand how bad the situation could be.*

Back to the story, when I booked my trip in a hurry and eventually visited them, their condition was far worse than I had imagined. The affected body part was literally rotten, and it stank. Visitors had to wear masks; otherwise, it was hard not to throw up.

The patient also believed in some “witchcraft”- level remedies, and trying those only made their condition worse, considering doctors all could not do anything to help. It happened when a person was so desperate that they would seek every bit of opportunity for a cure. People who have not suffered from this cannot understand why they could do such irrational things - such kind of long-term diseases can easily destroy one's faith and common sense.

Did we try “terminal care”? Of course we did, but they were just connected to various tubes and asked to undergo a hundred irrelevant tests - the hospitals were trying to milk us for as much money as they could before the patient died. *The problem with these doctors were, they would not offer pain relief or qualify of life solutions either, because terminal care is probably too advanced/high-end in China still.* To make the matter worse, nobody in the family was an expert in the medical field.

Edit 2: no, I am not affected by active users from r/China_irl or r/sino, beacause I knew who they are and what they are going to say. You cannot wake a person who is pretending to be asleep.

Edit: I fixed some grammar and spelling issues. It was hard to concentrate while writing such a story.

For the sake of the people still living in China, I'm not going to reveal many details, as anyone who is not naive knows that the CCP is very good at witch-hunting and has been shameless in this regard.

Recently, I visited China again after many years because a family member was dying. They had been diagnosed with a terminal disease several years ago, but all the doctors refused to help since then. The original words were like "" such a chronic condition wouldn't develop fast"". Well, guess it was not the case later.

*I somehow understood that Chinese doctors had their own reasons/concerns, such as avoiding the doctor-patient disputes, which are very common in China. Also, I hate to express it, but many Chinese doctors will try to persuade the patient's family to give up on terminal diseases, as ""it is wasting the money"". I am not going to talk about it too much here, as it needs a new post to make people understand how bad the situation could be.*

Back to the story, when I booked my trip in a hurry and eventually visited them, their condition was far worse than I had imagined. The affected body part was literally rotten, and it stank. Visitors had to wear masks; otherwise, it was hard not to throw up.

The patient also believed in some “witchcraft”- level remedies, and trying those only made their condition worse, considering doctors all could not do anything to help. It happened when a person was so desperate that they would seek every bit of opportunity for a cure. People who have not suffered from this cannot understand why they could do such irrational things - such kind of long-term diseases can easily destroy one's faith and common sense.

Did we try “terminal care”? Of course we did, but they were just connected to various tubes and asked to undergo a hundred irrelevant tests - the hospitals were trying to milk us for as much money as they could before the patient died. *The problem with these doctors were, they would not offer pain relief or qualify of life solutions either, because terminal care is probably too advanced/high-end in China still.* To make the matter worse, nobody in the family was an expert in the medical field.

Eventually, after several weeks of torture for everyone, including the patient, they passed away. The dying family member had begged us countless times to help them end their suffering, but how could we do that? Before their death, the unbearable pain even made them curse a family member who had been taking care of them for months! I couldn't believe my ears when I heard those harsh words.

Now you may think this was the end of the story, but the local government still wanted to complicate matters as much as they could. The deceased had made a coffin for their planned burial, but it had been banned months ago in their area. You needed to pay someone to remove it from the warehouse, and I don't want to repeat the horrendous process -

*An update here: the local government would collect all coffins at a low price, but you had to pay to have a coffin transported to their location. However, the local government was also selling coffins at double the price to nearby areas where burial was allowed. You can judge for yourself: was the local government doing this for the sake of land use?*

That was just one of the many miserable stories under China's ""moderately prosperous society in all respects,"" which is absolutely ridiculous propaganda. I bet for ordinary people, only those who are brainwashed by the CCP or have Stockholm Syndrome would praise it. I am not sure if foreigners can receive better quality medical care in China, but for civilians, having any critical disease is a nightmare for their whole family. We all understand that this (the healthcare system) is just the tip of the iceberg.

My entry to China wasn't pleasant either. I was asked a hundred questions about whom I was visiting, when, where, and why. My non-Chinese passport was examined so carefully, as if I were a spy. Oh, and of course, ten fingerprints had to be recorded for several rounds.

As a side note, during a formal dinner for a medical professional who once saved the life of another family member, it was beyond frustrating to hear them talk about how much gay people disgusted them and how little they could tolerate gay relationships. That said, when China wasn't called China, the hate against LGBT was not so fierce as today.

In the end, the necessary visit to China successfully planted a seed of various negative feelings in my mind, and I am still heartbroken while writing this post.",1730419970.0,575,Aidenfred,Lost_Mango_3404,Aidenfred,1730443078.0,8,POLITICAL

My entry to China wasn't pleasant either. I was asked a hundred questions about whom I was visiting, when, where, and why. My non-Chinese passport was examined so carefully, as if I were a spy. Oh, and of course, ten fingerprints had to be recorded for several rounds.

As a side note, during a formal dinner for a medical professional who once saved the life of another family member, it was beyond frustrating to hear them talk about how much gay people disgusted them and how little they could tolerate gay relationships.

My recent visit to China literally gave me a life-time PTSD,1ggsywx,"**Edit 3: I am very suprised that I had to tell many users who praised the healthcare of China that China has more cities apart from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The population of these 4 tier one cities is only 80 million in total, while China has 1.4 billion people. You cannot use your experience in the top 5% to demonstrate quality medical services in China.**

Edit 2: no, I am not affected by active users from r/China_irl or r/sino, beacause I knew who they are and what they are going to say. You cannot wake a person who is pretending to be asleep.

Edit: I fixed some grammar and spelling issues. It was hard to concentrate while writing such a story.

For the sake of the people still living in China, I'm not going to reveal many details, as anyone who is not naive knows that the CCP is very good at witch-hunting and has been shameless in this regard.

Recently, I visited China again after many years because a family member was dying. They had been diagnosed with a terminal disease several years ago, but all the doctors refused to help since then. The original words were like "" such a chronic condition wouldn't develop fast"". Well, guess it was not the case later.

*I somehow understood that Chinese doctors had their own reasons/concerns, such as avoiding the doctor-patient disputes, which are very common in China. Also, I hate to express it, but many Chinese doctors will try to persuade the patient's family to give up on terminal diseases, as ""it is wasting the money"". I am not going to talk about it too much here, as it needs a new post to make people understand how bad the situation could be.*

Back to the story, when I booked my trip in a hurry and eventually visited them, their condition was far worse than I had imagined. The affected body part was literally rotten, and it stank. Visitors had to wear masks; otherwise, it was hard not to throw up.

The patient also believed in some “witchcraft”- level remedies, and trying those only made their condition worse, considering doctors all could not do anything to help. It happened when a person was so desperate that they would seek every bit of opportunity for a cure. People who have not suffered from this cannot understand why they could do such irrational things - such kind of long-term diseases can easily destroy one's faith and common sense.

Did we try “terminal care”? Of course we did, but they were just connected to various tubes and asked to undergo a hundred irrelevant tests - the hospitals were trying to milk us for as much money as they could before the patient died. *The problem with these doctors were, they would not offer pain relief or qualify of life solutions either, because terminal care is probably too advanced/high-end in China still.* To make the matter worse, nobody in the family was an expert in the medical field.

Eventually, after several weeks of torture for everyone, including the patient, they passed away. The dying family member had begged us countless times to help them end their suffering, but how could we do that? Before their death, the unbearable pain even made them curse a family member who had been taking care of them for months! I couldn't believe my ears when I heard those harsh words.

Now you may think this was the end of the story, but the local government still wanted to complicate matters as much as they could.

Also, I hate to express it, but many Chinese doctors will try to persuade the patient's family to give up on terminal diseases, as ""it is wasting the money"". I am not going to talk about it too much here, as it needs a new post to make people understand how bad the situation could be.*

Back to the story, when I booked my trip in a hurry and eventually visited them, their condition was far worse than I had imagined. The affected body part was literally rotten, and it stank. Visitors had to wear masks; otherwise, it was hard not to throw up.

The patient also believed in some “witchcraft”- level remedies, and trying those only made their condition worse, considering doctors all could not do anything to help. It happened when a person was so desperate that they would seek every bit of opportunity for a cure. People who have not suffered from this cannot understand why they could do such irrational things - such kind of long-term diseases can easily destroy one's faith and common sense.

Did we try “terminal care”? Of course we did, but they were just connected to various tubes and asked to undergo a hundred irrelevant tests - the hospitals were trying to milk us for as much money as they could before the patient died. *The problem with these doctors were, they would not offer pain relief or qualify of life solutions either, because terminal care is probably too advanced/high-end in China still.* To make the matter worse, nobody in the family was an expert in the medical field.

Eventually, after several weeks of torture for everyone, including the patient, they passed away. The dying family member had begged us countless times to help them end their suffering, but how could we do that? Before their death, the unbearable pain even made them curse a family member who had been taking care of them for months! I couldn't believe my ears when I heard those harsh words.

Now you may think this was the end of the story, but the local government still wanted to complicate matters as much as they could. The deceased had made a coffin for their planned burial, but it had been banned months ago in their area. You needed to pay someone to remove it from the warehouse, and I don't want to repeat the horrendous process -

*An update here: the local government would collect all coffins at a low price, but you had to pay to have a coffin transported to their location. However, the local government was also selling coffins at double the price to nearby areas where burial was allowed. You can judge for yourself: was the local government doing this for the sake of land use?*

That was just one of the many miserable stories under China's ""moderately prosperous society in all respects,"" which is absolutely ridiculous propaganda. I bet for ordinary people, only those who are brainwashed by the CCP or have Stockholm Syndrome would praise it. I am not sure if foreigners can receive better quality medical care in China, but for civilians, having any critical disease is a nightmare for their whole family. We all understand that this (the healthcare system) is just the tip of the iceberg.

My entry to China wasn't pleasant either. I was asked a hundred questions about whom I was visiting, when, where, and why. My non-Chinese passport was examined so carefully, as if I were a spy. Oh, and of course, ten fingerprints had to be recorded for several rounds.

As a side note, during a formal dinner for a medical professional who once saved the life of another family member, it was beyond frustrating to hear them talk about how much gay people disgusted them and how little they could tolerate gay relationships. That said, when China wasn't called China, the hate against LGBT was not so fierce as today.

In the end, the necessary visit to China successfully planted a seed of various negative feelings in my mind, and I am still heartbroken while writing this post.",1730419970.0,575,Aidenfred,Volodimica,Aidenfred,1730586371.0,1,POLITICAL

My recent visit to China literally gave me a life-time PTSD,1ggsywx,"**Edit 3: I am very suprised that I had to tell many users who praised the healthcare of China that China has more cities apart from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The population of these 4 tier one cities is only 80 million in total, while China has 1.4 billion people. You cannot use your experience in the top 5% to demonstrate quality medical services in China.**

Edit 2: no, I am not affected by active users from r/China_irl or r/sino, beacause I knew who they are and what they are going to say. You cannot wake a person who is pretending to be asleep.

Edit: I fixed some grammar and spelling issues. It was hard to concentrate while writing such a story.

For the sake of the people still living in China, I'm not going to reveal many details, as anyone who is not naive knows that the CCP is very good at witch-hunting and has been shameless in this regard.

Recently, I visited China again after many years because a family member was dying. They had been diagnosed with a terminal disease several years ago, but all the doctors refused to help since then. The original words were like "" such a chronic condition wouldn't develop fast"". Well, guess it was not the case later.

*I somehow understood that Chinese doctors had their own reasons/concerns, such as avoiding the doctor-patient disputes, which are very common in China. Also, I hate to express it, but many Chinese doctors will try to persuade the patient's family to give up on terminal diseases, as ""it is wasting the money"". I am not going to talk about it too much here, as it needs a new post to make people understand how bad the situation could be.*

Back to the story, when I booked my trip in a hurry and eventually visited them, their condition was far worse than I had imagined. The affected body part was literally rotten, and it stank. Visitors had to wear masks; otherwise, it was hard not to throw up.

The patient also believed in some “witchcraft”- level remedies, and trying those only made their condition worse, considering doctors all could not do anything to help. It happened when a person was so desperate that they would seek every bit of opportunity for a cure. People who have not suffered from this cannot understand why they could do such irrational things - such kind of long-term diseases can easily destroy one's faith and common sense.

Did we try “terminal care”? Of course we did, but they were just connected to various tubes and asked to undergo a hundred irrelevant tests - the hospitals were trying to milk us for as much money as they could before the patient died. *The problem with these doctors were, they would not offer pain relief or qualify of life solutions either, because terminal care is probably too advanced/high-end in China still.* To make the matter worse, nobody in the family was an expert in the medical field.

Eventually, after several weeks of torture for everyone, including the patient, they passed away. The dying family member had begged us countless times to help them end their suffering, but how could we do that? Before their death, the unbearable pain even made them curse a family member who had been taking care of them for months! I couldn't believe my ears when I heard those harsh words.

Now you may think this was the end of the story, but the local government still wanted to complicate matters as much as they could. The deceased had made a coffin for their planned burial, but it had been banned months ago in their area. You needed to pay someone to remove it from the warehouse, and I don't want to repeat the horrendous process -

*An update here: the local government would collect all coffins at a low price, but you had to pay to have a coffin transported to their location. However, the local government was also selling coffins at double the price to nearby areas where burial was allowed. You can judge for yourself: was the local government doing this for the sake of land use?*

That was just one of the many miserable stories under China's ""moderately prosperous society in all respects,"" which is absolutely ridiculous propaganda. I bet for ordinary people, only those who are brainwashed by the CCP or have Stockholm Syndrome would praise it. I am not sure if foreigners can receive better quality medical care in China, but for civilians, having any critical disease is a nightmare for their whole family.

Of course we did, but they were just connected to various tubes and asked to undergo a hundred irrelevant tests - the hospitals were trying to milk us for as much money as they could before the patient died. *The problem with these doctors were, they would not offer pain relief or qualify of life solutions either, because terminal care is probably too advanced/high-end in China still.* To make the matter worse, nobody in the family was an expert in the medical field.

Eventually, after several weeks of torture for everyone, including the patient, they passed away. The dying family member had begged us countless times to help them end their suffering, but how could we do that? Before their death, the unbearable pain even made them curse a family member who had been taking care of them for months! I couldn't believe my ears when I heard those harsh words.

Now you may think this was the end of the story, but the local government still wanted to complicate matters as much as they could. The deceased had made a coffin for their planned burial, but it had been banned months ago in their area. You needed to pay someone to remove it from the warehouse, and I don't want to repeat the horrendous process -

*An update here: the local government would collect all coffins at a low price, but you had to pay to have a coffin transported to their location. However, the local government was also selling coffins at double the price to nearby areas where burial was allowed. You can judge for yourself: was the local government doing this for the sake of land use?*

That was just one of the many miserable stories under China's ""moderately prosperous society in all respects,"" which is absolutely ridiculous propaganda. I bet for ordinary people, only those who are brainwashed by the CCP or have Stockholm Syndrome would praise it. I am not sure if foreigners can receive better quality medical care in China, but for civilians, having any critical disease is a nightmare for their whole family. We all understand that this (the healthcare system) is just the tip of the iceberg.

My entry to China wasn't pleasant either. I was asked a hundred questions about whom I was visiting, when, where, and why. My non-Chinese passport was examined so carefully, as if I were a spy. Oh, and of course, ten fingerprints had to be recorded for several rounds.

As a side note, during a formal dinner for a medical professional who once saved the life of another family member, it was beyond frustrating to hear them talk about how much gay people disgusted them and how little they could tolerate gay relationships. That said, when China wasn't called China, the hate against LGBT was not so fierce as today.

In the end, the necessary visit to China successfully planted a seed of various negative feelings in my mind, and I am still heartbroken while writing this post.",1730419970.0,575,Aidenfred,xjpmhxjo,Aidenfred,1730432705.0,-22,POLITICAL
My recent visit to China literally gave me a life-time PTSD,1ggsywx,"**Edit 3: I am very suprised that I had to tell many users who praised the healthcare of China that China has more cities apart from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The population of these 4 tier one cities is only 80 million in total, while China has 1.4 billion people. You cannot use your experience in the top 5% to demonstrate quality medical services in China.**

Edit 2: no, I am not affected by active users from r/China_irl or r/sino, beacause I knew who they are and what they are going to say. You cannot wake a person who is pretending to be asleep.

Edit: I fixed some grammar and spelling issues. It was hard to concentrate while writing such a story.

For the sake of the people still living in China, I'm not going to reveal many details, as anyone who is not naive knows that the CCP is very good at witch-hunting and has been shameless in this regard.

Recently, I visited China again after many years because a family member was dying. They had been diagnosed with a terminal disease several years ago, but all the doctors refused to help since then. The original words were like "" such a chronic condition wouldn't develop fast"". Well, guess it was not the case later.

*I somehow understood that Chinese doctors had their own reasons/concerns, such as avoiding the doctor-patient disputes, which are very common in China. Also, I hate to express it, but many Chinese doctors will try to persuade the patient's family to give up on terminal diseases, as ""it is wasting the money"". I am not going to talk about it too much here, as it needs a new post to make people understand how bad the situation could be.*

Back to the story, when I booked my trip in a hurry and eventually visited them, their condition was far worse than I had imagined. The affected body part was literally rotten, and it stank. Visitors had to wear masks; otherwise, it was hard not to throw up.

The patient also believed in some “witchcraft”- level remedies, and trying those only made their condition worse, considering doctors all could not do anything to help. It happened when a person was so desperate that they would seek every bit of opportunity for a cure.

University exchange: Shanghai or Hong Kong?,1ghad24,"Hello everyone!

I am a Finnish international relations student looking to go on either an exchange semester next autumn, or full year exchange. Feel free to also share your opinion on if a full year or just a semester would be better!

I am completely set on Asia, as I am looking to learn the local language and continue working with the area in the future, while also experiencing a completely different culture and life. Now, my university only offers two universities in Asia: Fudan University in Shanghai, and City University of Hong Kong. I have already studied a bit of Mandarin, which would make learning the language in Shanghai a bit easier. Mandarin is also more useful as it has more speakers, of course. Shanghai would also be a lot more affordable. I have however also heard a lot of great experiences of doing an exchange semester in Hong Kong, while I personally don't know anyone who was in Shanghai.

I am looking to travel around Asia during my exchange, and intensively study the language and culture, not really to just party. Feel free to tell me your thoughts :)

Suzhou or Nanjing,1gh26i0,"Hi, I’ve been researching but not sure and looking for some advice please 🙏🏻 I have job offers in Nanjing and Suzhou. 

In Suzhou I would be living in SIP.

In Nanjing I would be in Qixia District.


The salaries are about the same, holiday about the same. Both 1 year contract. I am 35 years old, single but bringing my cat with me. I like nature and getting outside. I am not too bothered with night life. 

It would be nice to save money and I’ve read Nanjing would be cheaper, better air quality also. However, I’ve also read that this district in Nanjing is out in the “boonies”, suburban town with not much other than universities. 

From what I’ve read, Suzhou is great for foreigners but more touristy so overall cost of living is higher. 

Any advice from anyone who’s lived in either of those places would be greatly appreciated 🙏🏻

Up until 2018, I worked and held money at a CMB of a tier 2 city. All of it above board, paid taxes and all. No troubles of any kind either.

My debit card will expire in a year or two. I haven't used it since COVID. I haven't set foot back there since either. I lost access to the phone number it's tied to, and no mobile banking access.

I want to get my money out. How screwed am I?

What do I need?

- contract, signed or stamped
- paystubs, with tax amounts
- tax receipts from the government 
- anything else?

Assuming a cooperative employer, any chance of seeing my money one day?

I'd love to do it remotely, but guessing there's no chance in hell.",1730341615.0,6,some-china-alt,Humacti,some-china-alt,1730348153.0,10,OTHER

Is chinese astrology actually numerology?,1gfzmsq,"Asking more specifically about the 12 chinese animals.

See the animal changes on every year on a 12 year cycle. This is linked to numbers not planets. Jupiter has a 12 year cycle but its not exactly 12 years. If the animals were linked to Jupiter they yould need to change the year each animal is on every 100 years due to Jupiters cycle being less than 12 years.

Is there anythong astrological these 12 animals are linked to? As far as I can see they are only linked to numbers.

Searching for documentaries on each of the Chinese Provinces,1gfle83,"

Preferably in mandarin with English subtitles.

I am interested in the people that live there, their ethnicities and languages, the history of the individual provinces throughout the millennia, what is typical of them and what people from other provinces think about them.
What inventions came from where and were they more famous for scholastic, military, art, philosophical or engineering achievements, etc.

I'd prefer a series of individual documentaries about one province each.

But I guess i take what is available. 

I just want to learn as much as possible.

"Cultural context of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?",1gkixk7,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of my favorite films.

I'm interested in knowing more about the cultural context for the movie. I think I understand that as a Wuxia film it takes place in a mythical Chinese ""era of chivalry"" or something like that? Like European old stories have knights and honor and princesses and stuff like that, so does CTHD take place in the same kind of Chinese idealized historical context?

Does the story have nuances, archetypes and traditions that might be lost to non-Chinese? Like in one fight, Jade Fox paralyzes the opponent with some direct hits. I suppose this based on some traditional tales and medicine, as it is presented as so self evident in the movie? Are there more nuanced instances like this that westerners might miss? Like I'm always puzzled (in a good way) how the heroine in the end jumped an dissapp0eared to the fog. I don't *need* an explanation what it means or what happened. But is there some cultural context that might be lost to non-Chinese?

I’m heading to Beijing in a few days and am looking to buy tickets for the Great Wall. I found the website [en.mutianyugreatwall.com](http://en.mutianyugreatwall.com), and after checking their social media, it seems legit.

I’m considering the Adult Postcard Ticket, which includes a round-trip shuttle bus and cable car for 200 CNY (around $30). Is that a good deal, or should I be worried about being scammed? I don’t want a guide, as that would likely cost more.

How To Find Cowriters Who Know A Lot About Chinese History,1gfq6vx,"I am currently working on a novel set in George RR Martin's A Song Of Ice And Fire universe. The story is set in the Golden Empire of Yi Ti, which is GRRM's analogue for Imperial China. The events of the story run in tandem with the events of the ASOIAF book series. We follow 10 POV characters through the events of a great war between the azure, yellow, and orange emperors, loosely based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. I am searching for collaborators and contributors who are well versed in Chinese history, culture, politics, etc. My goal is to develop a pitch to HBO for their upcoming animated spinoff series set in the Golden Empire of Yi Ti. I am looking for similar creatives who would be interested in creating a fantasy China world that does honor to China's long and storied history. It is a very ambitious project, but I feel it would be a fun endeavor. I want the project to be authentic to the Chinese experience, so I am looking for people who want to create a respectful, realistic, and non-stereotypical world.",1730304437.0,0,LouDiPhilla,Forsaken-Review5638,LouDiPhilla,1730359071.0,1,CULTURAL
