3,Received a package that never was ordered. Now company that shipped it wants it back,"Received an unknown package that turned to be what looked like used junk with some small spiders crawling around inside. I re-taped it and placed in a  trash bag.  
After about a week i decided to just dispose of it at the recycling center of my apartment community.  A month later i got a text message from someone claiming to that the item was sent to me by mistake.  Anyone know what liabilities I may have?  
Never heard of this company and I have no idea how they got my name, address and phone number in the first place.

Amended:  
Trying to keep this short;  as some have mentioned this is probably some scam. I thought this also, so I did not bother contacting the shipper before disposing of the box of contents.   
  
However, I just did a quick google and apparently there is some law that says there may be some penalties for refusing to return mailed items shipped by mistake. I'm flabbergasted. Where I am from, we have no such obligation.  
  
""Article 39  Intentional refusal to return mail items that were received by mistake shall be subject to a fine of NT$2,000 to NT$10,000.""

5,Taiwanese people are the most rude hostile people I‚Äôve ever met in my life and Taiwan is much worse than other countries in Asia.,"Having just had yet another rude hostile interaction with a Taiwanese, this time in family mart, I now feel so fed up with Taiwan and the Taiwanese and want to leave ASAP. This woman at family mart literally shouted at me for daring to ask for syrup in my coffee. She shouted at me in Chinese in front of some other customers and I was so embarrassed and I had no idea what she was saying.

On Friday I made a post detailing how I felt Taiwan wasn‚Äôt what a lot of people on this sub make it out to be and now I want to give a follow up with some further points for the benefit of people in the rest of the world who may be considering Taiwan as a place to live.

Let‚Äôs start with the ‚ÄúTaiwanese are so friendly‚Äù nonsense

Since coming here I‚Äôve had to deal with so many hostile people, with several Interactions a week like the one I mentioned that happened to me today. Everyone looks at you like you‚Äôre an alien. Parents pull their children away from you. You walk into a restaurant and the staff try to ignore you. In my condo people are so unfriendly they will wait for another lift rather than getting into the same lift as someone else. My hotel I stayed at when I first got here, the staff tried to get everyone using a self-check in because they didn‚Äôt want to have to interact with anyone. Service staff would rather blame you than accepting their mistakes. The whole culture feels incredible rude and hostile.

I would advise anyone coming here to not expect to make a single Taiwanese friend, they don‚Äôt want to be friends. They don‚Äôt even get on well with each other, if you str and look at the people walking on the road or in a ma they will all have grumpy hostile face expressions. Groups of people walk together but they don‚Äôt talk or laugh with each other, they would rather just walk silently. Same in a restaurant, restaurants are often very quiet because nobody is talking to each other, they all just eat and look at their phones.

I would also advise anyone coming here that any potentially friendly interaction you have with a Taiwanese will be immensely fake and they will be hoping you leave them and go away as soon as possible or give them something (money).

I don‚Äôt mind this since I‚Äôm only here temporarily and I came with some other foreign friends but it would be very tough if you‚Äôre planning to move here long term.

Some other things which I really hate about Taiwan that never gets mentioned on this sub.

1. The public toilets. This supposedly developed modern country still has disgusting squat toilets all over the place. No modern country has these. Most supposedly poorer countries in south east Asia now have sit down toilets with bum gun as standard, Japan and Korea have bidet toilets as standard. Taiwan is terribly far behind with this.

2. Together with the squat toilets you will see bins full of disgusting soiled toilet paper. This is totally unnecessary and disgusting. I‚Äôve never seen this anywhere else and it makes me hate Taiwan everytime I see it.

3. The weather here is consistently awful. Summer is so unbearably hot you can‚Äôt even go outside at night without sweating (this is different to SE Asia where temperature cools down significantly at night). Mos days are horribly grey, rainy and overcast. I‚Äôve counted 18 rainy days in a row since I came here as well as 2 typhoons. You‚Äôll be forced to spend a lot of time indoors if you come to Taiwan.

4. The night markets. I can‚Äôt believe these are actual tourist attractions. They are hot, crowded and dirty with nowhere to sit. Go to Thailand if you want night markets. In Thailand every stand has ample seats and tables around it to sit and eat. As well as lots of clothes and accessory shops thrown in and concert stages for live bands to perform on (it‚Äôs really fun). You certainly won‚Äôt get that in Taiwan.

5. The garbage collection. Fortunately I don‚Äôt have to deal with this nonsense where I live. But the whole garbage collection situation is so ridiculous and unnecessary. The fact anyone can describe Taiwan as a convenient country when they have this system blows my mind.

6. Things take ages to repair when broken. One of The elevators broke in my building and wasn‚Äôt repaired for about two weeks, everywhere else I‚Äôve lived this would be fixed in a day or 2 max. Not to mention the fact places are constantly turning off the elevators ‚Äúto save electricity‚Äù forcing everyone to wait longer.

7. Constant sewage smell everywhere. When you‚Äôre walking just outside 101 mall you don‚Äôt expect to be breathing in sewage. Enough said.

8. Terrible tourist infrastructure. It‚Äôs embarrassing when people come to visit me and I have to recommend such a bad selection of hotels for them to stay at. Not to mention the fact all the beaches here are totally undeveloped with no beach resorts, beach clubs etc like other countries. A lot of beaches here are covered in garbage.

9. Bad breath everywhere. I‚Äôve never come across so many otherwise perfectly respectable people who otherwise have terrible breath as in Taiwan. Especially in the morning. It is so disgusting and I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so bad here. 


I'm posting this to give some balance to this incredibly delusion sub. We had someone yesterday asking something about the paper towels in restaurants and phrasing their question ""I love taiwan but ......?, I love Taiwan so much"" like seriously just ask your question. Pretty much every other country sub that I'm on people can just ask their questions and make comments about a place without all this weird profession of love that we see here.

15,Master‚Äôs degree at NTU vs europe,"I‚Äôm graduating with a bachelor‚Äôs in engineering and weighing whether to continue at my own school in Finland (Decently well recognised and ranked engineering university, top 150-200) vs applying to NTU. I‚Äôm looking specifically at the master‚Äôs programme in semiconductor technology at the graduate school of advanced technology.

I did an exchange period at NTUST and really miss the studying life in Taipei. After my undergrad I‚Äôve decided that the semiconductor industry is where I want to focus on. The industry is growing all over the world, including Finland where I‚Äôm from. I also have a lot of friends in Taiwan and generally wouldn‚Äôt mind working here at least while I‚Äôm young and don‚Äôt have kids. My mandarin is currently at TOCFL B level, and I can keep up quite well with conversation in mandarin only in a friend group. I imagine NTU would have the best semiconductor industry connections of almost any university, so with all the above factors, NTU is looking very tempting. However, I‚Äôm also aware of the downsides (asian degrees might not be as well recognized globally, and obviously Taiwan has much worse work culture)

Is it better to finish my degree quickly at home and then apply for jobs in Taiwan, or should I jump ship and do a master‚Äôs at NTU?

* i did look into the wiki - food section -&gt; not up to date(?)
* searched 'food' through this subreddit -&gt; there are a lot of good recommendations, but mostly is about the 'what', not the location

19,"Lost My Item in a Taxi‚Ä¶ Or So I Thought, Until I Caught the Driver Swiping It","Still in disbelief this is actually happened.

So yesterday (Sunday), a friend of mine (Taiwanese) is supposed to pick up a cake from a local pastry shop in Taipei.

Initially, the plan is for me to drive there, but since it‚Äôs Sunday and traffic is everywhere, I really don‚Äôt want to deal with finding a car parking spot later again (I found a sweet spot and just wanted to keep it), so we decide to take a taxi instead.

Uber has at least 10min wait time, and we see 2-3 taxis pass by already, so we just wave, and one minute later we‚Äôre inside a yellow car, heading toward our destination.

The plan is to get to the store, pick up the cake, and then take the same taxi back home.

We arrive near the cake place and ask the taxi driver if he can wait for us for two minutes since we‚Äôll be back soon.

Now here‚Äôs where it gets interesting: we return to the taxi, and as I get in the backseat, the first thing I notice is that my power bank, which I‚Äôve left right here on the backseat, is gone.

I‚Äôm very sure I left the power bank on the backseat (I didn‚Äôt take it with me to the cake store), so I start looking around for it. Finally I say to my friend, ‚ÄúThis is strange, but I had my power bank right here on the seat, and now it‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

As we head back, we ask the taxi driver multiple times if he‚Äôs seen our power bank or if anyone else might have entered the taxi and taken it, but he denies it.

This really puzzles me since I‚Äôm certain I left the power bank on the back seat so no one else except the taxi driver could have moved it.

This is a high-end power bank that‚Äôs been useful on countless occasions, so I don‚Äôt want to just let it go.

We tell the taxi driver that once we arrive, we want to search the car.

We stop on a different street near our destination (I don‚Äôt want the taxi driver to know exactly where we‚Äôre going), pay the fare, and start looking around.

After a few minutes of searching (including the front glovebox), we‚Äôre running out of options‚Äîbut I know the power bank is somewhere in this car.

I‚Äôm tired at this point and just want to end this and get on with the rest of my evening.

So I get out of the car, open the driver‚Äôs door, and politely ask him to stand up and get out of the car.

He says he won‚Äôt stand up and insists that this is all ridiculous and he doesn‚Äôt have time for it.

His reaction makes me feel more suspicious, as it shouldn‚Äôt be a big deal for him to stand up and help us search for the lost item.

I look around his seat while he‚Äôs sitting there, and then I spot a shiny USB cable coming out from literally beneath him.

I reach out (screw his personal space at this point), grab the cable, and pull the power bank from under his ass.

What. The. Fuck.

So he‚Äôs taken it from the back seat while we were away, hid it under his ass, and has been sitting on it the whole time while we search for it like dummies üò≠üò≠

Speechless, I give him that ‚Äúwhat the fuck, dude‚Äù look and shut the door. 

I am tired, I just want to go home.

The moment I shut the door, he quickly drives off, so I don‚Äôt have enough time to snap a photo of his car plate.

Still in disbelief as I type this. This is disappointing on so many levels; never in my life would I have expected someone to try and steal from me in Taiwan in such a dumb way. 
I‚Äôm European, and I‚Äôd expect this kind of thing at any time, day or night, back in Europe ‚Äî but not here.

24,Parental Pressure Advice for a Bystander,"I am one of those old foreign dudes that still plays with a skateboard (its great physical exercise and fun). I'm seeking some cultural advice from the wise redditors of r/Taiwan.    
  
Its no surprise that in Taiwan parents put a high amount of pressure on kids in education and sports. However there is this issue that I keep seeing over and over in the skate parks here. Kids will be too scared to perform a trick but there parents will put so much pressure on them that kids often leave the skatepark in tears. Let me explain a specific situation that happened.

The other day I was at the skatepark and notice a kid maybe 8 years old trying to learn to drop into the ramp for the first time. This is a very scary thing the first time you learn how to do this. I've seen first hand kids break wrist or ankles doing this. It takes lots of confidence and being comfortable in your own skill.

I notice he was really struggling to work up the courage to do it. After watching him for 15-30mins just standing on the top of the ramp asked him in Chinese if he wanted help and offered to hold his hand to help him go down the ramp for the first time. The child declined the big scary bearded man's help, understandable. 

After about another 30-60mins of this. His dad came over and just started assaulting him with pressure. Saying stuff like ""Why are you standing here for so long, why did we even come? Stop being a coward...blah blah blah"" The kid was in tears as the dad was pressuring him to go down the ramp. The kid kept trying to build up the courage to go down but backed down every time, which caused the dad to assault him with more words. Honestly I couldn't understand everything he was saying or hear him very well the whole time.

My Taiwanese friend, who we mostly talk in Chinese switches to English and starts talking to me about the situation to avoid the dad understanding. Another Taiwanese jumps in and is like ""This is how some Taiwanese parents are, its not good."" 

Skateboarding culture is generally about pushing yourself and trying to push self compare your own skill with yourself verses competing with others (though there is a space for this). 

I didn't do anything to intervene in the situation cause I didn't want to make this worse for the kid. But I had an itch to just say to the dad ""Why don't you show him how to do it first."" Very well knowing the dude probably can't even ride on a skateboard. Or even trying to have a sloppy conversation in Chinese about ""Don't put so much pressure on him. I was 12 before I did this for the first time. The kid has time and the pressure will just make him more scared. Let him push himself when he is ready.""

Or trying to just privately go over and encourage the kid and tell him he's doing alright. but the dad never left his side the rest of the time I was there. He just towered over his kid trying to force him do the trick.

But I never said anything and it drives me crazy. I know this is a foreigner problem to some degree. But they are in the skatepark which is my culture. Skateboarding is a culture that expands the world with small variants. 

I'm looking for advice for what to do in these situations, it sadly happens a lot in Taiwan. I've never seen so many kids crying while at a skatepark. Image seeing someone crying while doing down a waterslide, like what?! Like just image if a kid was too afraid to go into a baseball batting cage and the dad was like forcing the kid to do to the point of tears or forcing a kid to be a Football goalie but didn't want to get hit in the face with balls (just trying to make this situation more relatable).  
  
Should I just ignore it? Is there a way to intervene in a way to make the situation better for the kid or help the dad to take a step back? What would you do in this situation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1gj313p/parental_pressure_advice_for_a_bystander/,self.taiwan,2024-11-04 01:34:01,leafbreath,2024-11-04

I'm curious, is that considered common in Taiwan or is it seen at something not good. He beat her a lot, and it was pretty violent, I saw some of it when I was 5 years old. I was adopted and I can't tell if something is/was wrong with my parents, or they were just common Taiwanese from previous generations.

26,Where to buy hair products?,"I know this might be silly, but I‚Äôm definitely unsure where to buy hair conditioner specifically. I have curly hair and conditioner is a pretty big part of my hair routine, but since I‚Äôm traveling Taiwan I figured I could just buy some here for my stay.

27,Influencer gold cards,"Hi Taiwan friends! I did a working holiday in Taiwan a few years ago and fell in love with Taiwan and would love to move back. I'm British, 33, I have a degree, a TEFL certificate and my Mandarin is upper intermediate. I have tried teaching English and I'm really not good at it and it stresses me out but it is a backup option.

Does anyone know if social media influencers or YouTubers get gold cards? What category do they fall under? That's an option I can work on building to get an ARC eventually as I have 12k followers on tiktok right now. I was offered some money to make some videos for a government project while I was in Taiwan but I had already booked my flight home so I missed it. I did wonder if I went back on a tourist visa and made similar videos I might be able to get a gold card as a journalist eventually perhaps. My friend has an artist gold card because she did a lot of work on government projects so it seems like doing government work and promoting Taiwan is a good route to an ARC.",https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1gj1o0f/influencer_gold_cards/,self.taiwan,2024-11-04 00:25:54,Suspicious_Guard_146,2024-11-04

32,University Grad/Masters Admissions at Taiwan Universities ,"ÊÇ®Â•Ω r/taiwan !

Although I have yet to finish my studies and decide a career path (and gain a bit of work experience too), I was wondering (with a bit of daydreaming/what-if sparkled on top) how difficult would be for me to get admitted into a masters in Taiwan(namely NTU, National Tsing Hua, NTUST... ), since from what I saw online, their admissions rates seems to be relatively high (hovering between 30-50%), for the reputation they hold.

For a bit of background info: I'm a computer engineering undergrad student with a 7.7(not bad but not perfect either) average on the Spanish grading system (a 5 is the passing grade and roughly equivalent to a 60%), and planning to get a few undergrad research and normal internships to get a grasp of what I want to do after I finish my degree. As for languages, I currently possess an English level of 203 (Cambridge CAE), a few dabbles in French and Esperanto, and I'm planning to study Chinese over the summer holidays.

Regarding why Taiwan, setting aside the relevancy it has on my sector, after an exchange semester at Shih Chien University, I fell in love with the food and culture(and the Taipei metro!), and to be honest I wouldn't mind spending a few years in living and studying in Taiwan.

33,Best (or favorite) Enka songs? (Ëá∫Ë™ûÊºîÊ≠å),"If you don‚Äôt know Enka, you might have still heard it‚Äîmaybe on a taxi radio or echoing from a karaoke tent in the mountains. Here is an introduction:

&gt;Enka originates from Japan and has been popularized in Taiwan in the 60's and 70's, in songs of nostalgic feelings, a certain longing for the ""lost home"" (hint: *the mainland*), or shared identity through love and companionship. Here is [one example](https://youtu.be/yp3jvxW-LyM), released in 1992.

Since the most popular Taiwanese Enka songs are in Hokkien (Ëá∫Ë™û / T√°iy«î), I would argue that Enka also served as a refuge for expressing and celebrating the Taiwanese language during an era when it was politically marginalized under pre-1987 (end of martial law) KMT rule.

If you know Taiwanese Enka very well, do you have any favorite tracks or authentic recordings? I‚Äôm especially interested in good-quality recordings (no tacky TV stage performances, if possible) that really capture the artistic side of this genre. Feel free to share any playlists, albums, or even recommendations for live Enka performances in Taiwan.

Reason: I'm putting together my own curated playlist to share with my friends, local and abroad. **Thank you for your contributions!**",https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1gitb0p/best_or_favorite_enka_songs_Ëá∫Ë™ûÊºîÊ≠å/,self.taiwan,2024-11-03 18:16:24,TomFichtnerLeipzig,2024-11-03

70,"Selling a house in Taiwan, real estate agency says we are liable for repairs for 5 years after completion??","TLDR: Sold a house in Taipei, typhoons messed it up, real estate agency says we are liable for repairs **for 5 years** after selling the house. Is this true?

Longer:
Hello, my wife's father is a Taiwanese citizen and he moved to North America around 20 years ago. When his mom died, he inherited her house in Taipei and kept renting it to the original tenants.     

Now, he fell sick a few years ago and my wife decided to sell the old house in Taipei so that he can have some money to retire. My wife and I live in Europe, so we have been going through a real estate agency in Taipei for the sale of the house.

Before the sale, the agency hired a bunch of contractors to fix things up: leaky pipes, leaky windows (lots of leaky stuff in Taipei apparently), moldy walls etc. We have paid an insane amount of money before even selling the house.

Now the house is technically sold, but there has been one of the worst typhoon seasons ever in Taiwan, so apparently things have started to leak again. The real estate agency keeps sending us bills for the repairs, even tho we do not own the house anymore, and they said that we are liable for this **for another 5 years**.

Can anyone here confirm? We fixed up a house, sold it, and now every typhoon season we are gonna have to spend tens of thousands to fix someone else's property while they get the rent money?? I am afraid we are getting scammed.

Thanks for everyone that can shed a light on it, I'm useless as I cannot read chinese and my wife's reading level is not enough for legal documents since she was raised in North America.

Currently the park is closed, but you can go driving through it from Guanyuan to Hualien (or the other way).¬†You need to check that the roads are open, check the National Park website. You have three different parts and each part have different opening times to go through, so you need to calculate what time you need to go and what time you need to stop.

\*If it says only ""10:00"", it means that if you will be late in 20 minutes, it will be closed - you must be early.

When I did it, I did took a lot of stops in the park and did a small hike even though it's not accepted, nobody will stop you or check you. Iv'e made a lot of stops in the road no problem with it. I talked with the visior center and they think it will take two years to recover all the trails. The park has changed a lot, but nature is still amazing!

Please note: it can be dangerous, if you go, do it with caution!¬†

95,Any of you teach at or have kids going to ‚Äúbilingual‚Äù schools? How the heck are things being fit into the curriculum?,"I‚Äôm just a clueless boob interested in how 1‚Äì12 schooling is done
here nowadays compared to my days (almost two decades ago)
and this question is part of that overarching theme.
Forgive me for any gross misunderstanding.
In Taichung there are several private ‚Äúbilingual‚Äù schools
like Korrnell Ritz (Taichung doesn‚Äôt have public ones yet)
but all of these are surprisingly tight‚Äêlipped about
how they run things to the general public.
My understanding is that to be a ‚Äúbilingual‚Äù school
basically every subject is taught in both Chinese and English.
Doesn‚Äôt that inflate class time quite a bit,
as you‚Äôd have to teach everything twice, give out two tests etc.?
Do kids also get basically twice the amount of homework
compared to at a ‚Äúmonolingual‚Äù school?
Are they nowadays just expected to spend even more time on schoolwork
or are some topics omitted from a ‚Äúmonolingual‚Äù curriculum to make it bilingual?

Furthermore a few of those schools claim to have a ‚Äúdual‚Äêtrack‚Äù curriculum (ÈõôËªåË™≤Á∂±)
so like they offer a domestic one and a foreign one usually American.
My understanding is because these schools are advertised as ‚Äúbilingual‚Äù
and not ‚Äúinternational‚Äù schools,
students are learning *two* countries‚Äô worth of K12 material.
So like are students learning U.S. history and government in addition to ROC civics?
How in the world does all that extra stuff fit into their curriculum and class schedules?

96,Taiwan is not what people make it out to be - Be Warned! ,"Having lived here for 3 months, I feel I have to challenge some of the excessive praise I see for Taiwan on this community and elsewhere. 

Having previously lived in Thailand, I‚Äôm bitterly disappointed with Taiwan. I came here expecting  a very developed modern country, with friendly people and tasty food and everything being super convenient. Well that is not what I have experienced.


Take ‚Äúthe Taiwanese people are so friendly‚Äù
I feel like the Taiwanese are the most hostile people I‚Äôve ever come across in my life. I‚Äôve had far more friendly interactions with people from every other country I‚Äôve visited or lived in.


Some examples

I was trying on clothes at a shop and they didn‚Äôt fit so tried to hand them back to the staff member who was at the changing rooms. She just pointed and said ‚Äútable‚Äù. Like wtf? In pretty much the rest of the world, they would said ‚Äúoh please put it on the table‚Äù or just take it from you. 

I wanted a bag at 7-eleven and asked for a bag, here you can get small 2ntd bags and big 5ntd bags. The woman gave me the big one when I only had 3 things so I gently told her a small bag is fine. She literally snatched the bag and shoved a smaller one at me really aggressively. 

I had to pay for something at a hospital here and when I handed the money over, the woman took it without looking at me or saying a word. In most countries people would say thanks. In most Asian countries even, people bow slightly when taking money from a customer. I was quite shocked. 

I genuinely don‚Äôt understand where the ‚ÄúTaiwanese are so friendly‚Äù mantra comes from because I haven‚Äôt experienced it at all. Everyone walks around with a grumpy face all the time. In my building people don‚Äôt even get in the lift together if they can avoid it. Compare this to Americans, Thais, Malaysians, Italians even British and their warmth and friendliness is so much more than Taiwanese. 


Second myth is ‚ÄúTaiwanese food is so good‚Äù
I genuinely don‚Äôt know what people who say this used to be eating. 
What do you think tastes so nice?
Beef noodles? Oily and bland
Xiao long bao? They taste alright but nothing special
Dan bing? Any omelette in Europe is better
Deep fried rice ball? It made me want to throw up 
Pot stickers? Smells gross
Bubble tea? The bubbles are gross
And then if you want any foreign food here, it tastes horrible and it‚Äôs massively overpriced and ‚ÄúTaiwanfied‚Äù
Most of the local Taiwanese restaurants are pretty horrible places as well with bland walls and small stools to sit on


‚ÄúTaiwan is so convenient‚Äù hahahah no

It‚Äôs not convenient not being given a precise appointment time at hospital but rather a vague 13:00-16:00.
It‚Äôs not convenient that food panda and Uber eats are mostly in Chinese
It‚Äôs not convenient that convenience stores don‚Äôt have medicine and only have 1 or 2 people working in them leaving you to queue for a long time to pay. 
It‚Äôs not convenient that I have to order by putting crosses on a piece of paper (again in Chinese) rather than being asked by a waiter/waitress. Some ‚Äúrestaurants‚Äù even then ask you to clear your own table! 
It‚Äôs not convenient that most restaurants are closed 14:00-17:00‚Ä¶ what if I want to eat then
Sorry but Taiwan is not convenient. 

‚ÄúModern developed country‚Äù okay no

5 minutes driving from Taoyuan airport to the city will put that myth to bed. Most of the buildings look like Soviet mass housing. Utterly hideous and no where near on Singapore, Japan or Hong Kong‚Äôs level. When I walk down my street (which is in Xinyi, a supposedly high end area) I have a constant stench of sewage together with a lack of pavements (sidewalks). And there is a huge lack of housing. Thai middle class live in condos with rooftop pools, gyms and free parking. Taiwanese middle class live somewhere where they are luckily to have their own kitchen.  The malls here are also so boring. They are literally all the same. If you‚Äôre familiar with Bangkok‚Äôs incredible mall scene you‚Äôll be very disappointed with Taipei. 

I can‚Äôt wait to leave this miserable place and it‚Äôs grumpy hostile people behind. 



EDIT: The responses here have been very insightful. I think the people who defend and praise Taiwan are the most fragile people I‚Äôve ever come across, it‚Äôs like they know the place they promote is flawed and can‚Äôt bare when it gets pointed out to them. It feels like PRC levels of fragility. I highly doubt such a vindictive response would happen if I were to make a post about most other countries. 

Quite a few responses are actually agreeing with me though, which I wasn‚Äôt expecting given this is the Taiwan sub and suggests I‚Äôm not the only one to feel like this.

149,Applying for Taiwan Passport and Household Registration and Conscription Overseas Exemption,"Hi All,

So just a little background. I was born in the US to Taiwanese parents and have never had a Taiwanese Passport or Household registration. I've been looking to get move forward with applying for citizenship through my parents, but have avoided it since there was a years residency requirement, the military service requirement and I couldn't step away from the US that long, until they did away with the required stay. I've gotten the basic process of getting my passport and household registration along with the required documents. 

My question is related closer to military service requirement and being exempt due to living overseas. I know I can apply for an Overseas ID for Military Service Purposes, but wanted to know what the proper way or sequence this should all be done. I know I should get my passport before going to Taiwan to get my household registration, but what about obtaining an overseas status. Does it apply to me as someone who's lived in the US his entire life, but will only have recently gotten his citizenship. And as I need the household registration to apply for the overseas status, will I be conscripted the moment I receive my household registration?

Thanks in advance and happy to clear up any details!",https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1gg1i56/applying_for_taiwan_passport_and_household/,self.taiwan,2024-10-31 00:11:32,InsipiredAllure,2024-10-31

So instead of 2(sex)-1-1, I was on 2-0-1(sex)-1, which most likely means that I was unprotected. The guy finished inside me and after the deed I noticed I had some bleeding.!&lt;

&gt;!Now 18 days later I'm feeling mild flu-like symptoms. It might be just a coincidence, but I'm panicking regardless and can barely sleep.

Maternal grandmother - Ah Mah  
Maternal aunt - (Number) Ah yi  
***Maternal aunt's husband - Unsure***  
Maternal uncle - (Number) Jojo  
***Maternal uncle's wife - Unsure***

Aunt - (number) Gugu  
***Aunt's husband - Unsure***  
Uncle - (Number) Susu  
***Uncle's wife - Unsure***

General aunt (not related) - Ah yi?  
General uncle (not related) - susu?

I also have a very odd situation where my dad's little sister married my mom's older brother. Their kids and I joke about how we're super cousins. How would I address this aunt/uncle?

1. I currently pay rent every month on the 12th. Am I supposed to give my one month notice on that date? What happens if I were to give notice, say sometime on the 1st of November? Am I then only required to pay rent from the 12th to the 30th? Basically, can I save some rent money by notifying my landlord(s) early?

2. My landlord(s) will be receiving one month rent as compensation, am I still required to give them permission to show off the apartment to prospective renters?

I think that the textbooks used are... just ok. They're not super helpful because the dialogues are often pretty random, like about child marriage or just uncommon situations. Unfortunately, it seems like lotsa Taiwanese textbooks just wanna have pretty pictures but not really teach stuff.

Vocabulary is therefore also pretty random because it's based on the dialogue, so students might learn a word like ""pretty"" or ""strict"" but not their opposites like ""ugly"" or ""easygoing.""

When I learn different languages, I find it's been more helpful to learn lessons in terms of themes like the classroom, the office, going grocery shopping, eating at a restaurant, the bedroom, hobbies, etc.

Are there any Taiwanese EFL textbooks like this? Unfortunately, when I try looking for these kinds of textbooks, they're either all in English or use Simplified Chinese.

192,**TYPHOON KONG-REY** Update Thread,"First, it's important to know that typhoons can be something or nothing. Don't freak out about them; just be cautious and up-to-date.

The periphery of Typhoon Kong-Rey will likely make an impact on Taiwan starting Wednesday. It's on track to make landfall as a typhoon in eastern Taiwan in either Hualien or Taitung county on Thursday. Weather will probably be the worst on Thursday and Friday.

# General info

* **Name:** Kong-Rey (Leon)
* **Status:** [SEA AND LAND WARNING ](https://www.cwa.gov.tw/V8/E/P/Typhoon/TY_WARN.html)
* **Current Category:** Tropical Storm
* ^(- Definitions for Category:) [^(Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale)](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php)
* **Risks:** High Winds, Dangerous Seas, Potential for Flooding &amp; Landslides
* **Cancelations:** 

^(See DGPA's website for updates:) [^(English)](https://www.dgpa.gov.tw/typh/daily/ndse.html) ^(/) [^(‰∏≠Êñá)](https://www.dgpa.gov.tw/typh/daily/nds.html)

* **Transportation:**

# Advisory

If you've never experienced one, basically:

* **Stay in doors when the typhoon hits.** The water and wind aren't necessarily dangerous by themselves, but when they start to affect rusty store signage and poorly affixed building tiles, object flying around can cause serious injury or death. Make sure to stay in covered walkways if you do have to go out.
* **Do NOT go to the** riverside or any parks, or beaches/coasts. There's a huge chance of danger especially when water becomes unpredictable. ***Especially*** ***do not*** **go to the beach or into the water**. People die every year because they underestimate the power of typhoons on the oceans and overestimate their abilities to deal with nature.
* In this vein, **bring anything you don't want to fly away inside**. Scooters fly away, so your plants, bicycles, etc., may as well.
* **Prepare water, food, and other potential necessities.** Regardless of where you are in Taiwan, always be aware of your surroundings and alert to the dangers of the typhoon. Typhoons can cause flooding, which disrupts water supplies. Your water may be shut off, so you may want to collect water in your tub or other containers for flushing toilets and/or washing.
* **You may lose electricity.** Make sure your phone is charged and try to reduce the amount of perishable foods in your refrigerator. A portable battery pack is nice for keeping your phone charged during things such as this. If you *really* need power, you may invest in a [UPS](http://www.newegg.com/UPS/SubCategory/ID-72).
* ***Do not*** **go hiking and try to stay out of the mountains** if it isn't absolutely necessary (i.e., you live there). Land slides are a real threat during typhoons. Also hiking in the **days following a typhoon** may also be dangerous since the ground still isn't fully settled and might be prone to landslides. Because of a typhoon all national parks (Yushan, Shei-pa, and Taroko) will close the hiking trails immediately. All permits are canceled too.
* If you have a windows, **stay away from them as much as possible** and maybe even **place something below them for potentially broken glass**.
* ***Do not*** **tape your windows**. It doesn't help and can actually make 1) potential flying shards more dangerous and 2) clean-up more difficult.
* **Potential for disruptions to transportation**. Roads can become impassible and disruptions to public transportation (buses, HSR, etc.) can occur due to flooding. If you plan on flying, it is highly advised that you keep an eye on your flight and check with airlines.
* **Residences can take on water even above flood lines**. Check all drains from outside for obstructions multiple times throughout the typhoon (if possibly done without danger).

What's worse is that the Taichung government didn‚Äôt even suspend their operations or fine them; they simply gave them time to conduct a recall... that‚Äôs pretty crazy!!

I guess cheap national health insurance here comes at a price.

My great grandparents are Â§ñÁúÅ‰∫∫ and left with CKS in 49. But in the mid sixties they moved to the US. My grandmother was born in China but grew up in Taipei until then.

A lot of them also married Taiwanese later on. 

My mom was born in the US (her dad‚Äôs side left China during the 1920s) and speaks a little Taiwanese as well. However, I was wondering if its fair to call myself Taiwanese.

227,Freshly cut fruit (for tasting) in Taipei,"I'm in Taipei and would like to try out some fresh fruit of different sorts because people say it's awesome here. The trouble is, I'm a tourist with just a couple of days here left, so I don't want to buy a lot of them, just a bit of everything to try. Ideally the fruit would be cut up, so I can eat them then, or at the hotel (I don't have a knife here).

Could anyone please suggest some place where I could buy cut fruit in small quantities in Taipei? I'm staying in Ximen area.

Happy to pay a bit more. 

Essentially, what I'm looking for is either some seller who wouldn't look at me like I've lost my marbles if I ask for just ONE dragon fruit, ONE custard apple, etc, and would be okay to cut them for me. Or, alternatively, somewhere that sells pre-cut (but still fresh) fruit in small boxes. Just want to try a bit of everything.

228,Visiting my brother in Taipei,"Hey guys and gals,
My brother is an expat in Taipei, and he has a spare bedroom. Before my brother moved to Taiwan the country was not on my radar what so ever. But knowing i could visit him + sleep at his place it seems like an insane idea not to visit him and find out what Taiwan has to offer! I was thinking of visiting in february so i can also see some festivals like the yanshui fireworks festival. 

I basicly have 2 questions:
1) how long should i visit Taiwan knowing i would want to end most if not all of my days in Taipei as my brother will be working during the day.

2) where would you reccomend me to go on my trip?

Thanks for your help!

253,Deezer available in 185+ countries - Taiwan is not one of them (yet) [alternative to Spotify],"You know the situation. You have been living off your MP3 archive for half your life, and pick music from various sources, enjoy live concerts, maybe listen to streaming episodes of [Through the Night](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/b006tmq9) from BBC Radio 3 etc.

You once considered only purchasing FLAC files instead of ripping MP3. You used to use Winamp, now you use foobar2000 on both the PC and your phone.

While everyone around you gets on with their life by simply using Spotify for all music and podcast related consumption.

Then, one day, in your home office, you notice that you keep listening to [the same 2006 James Holden set](https://youtu.be/I7mjJ7YYwBI) every day, over and over again. Something snaps in you, and you say, ""That's enough!!"" - you also finally want to jump into the pool of unlimited music discovery, experience all of humanity's audible creativity with the tap of a button.

But of course, being skeptical of monopolistic tendencies among major platform corporations, you look up alternatives to Spotify to see if there are other service providers that have an equally large music collection while maybe even paying more royalties to the artists, instead of paying off yet another luxury yacht for their shareholders.

So, learn about [Deezer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deezer), founded in 2007 (only one year after Spotify!), who is estimated to pay about 20 to 30% more royalties to the artists ([source](https://medium.com/soundcharts/what-do-music-streaming-services-pay-per-stream-and-why-it-actually-doesnt-matter-96b24247f9b6)). You think - cool, let's create an account and check it out. You will be part of the music streaming underground!

You open Deezer's website to find the sign-up button, yet you are created with BIG WHITE TEXT:

[Home page of Deezer, declaring: Sorry, Deezer is currently unavailable in your country.](https://preview.redd.it/kt63gakut3xd1.png?width=1921&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3194de1d7ae303eafc69463ffe96be1ce065cb91)

Your first instinct is to be proud of them. They actually consider Taiwan a country! Good boys!

Then reality hits you... this web service, around for 17 years, is ***not*** available in Taiwan, a country with unlimited data plans and a passion for free information? This can‚Äôt be right.

You ask yourself: OK, maybe Deezer, originating from France, is limited to a very small circle of countries due to the minefield of copyright law and predatory music labels which are stifling competition. Or maybe it's a EU market regulation thing? So you look up the number of countries that Deezer is available in in Deezer's help center:

[Deezer help center article, suggesting you to join the forum if your country is not on the list yet.](https://preview.redd.it/fmuzjgeju3xd1.png?width=1380&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0233912369708908db09af498890d6b0768843a2)

185 countries! That's almost ***all*** of the UN member states, which currently counts at 193, although [this episode of Map Men](https://youtu.be/3nB688xBYdY) has taught you that it is really difficult to count how many countries actually exist.

Deezer helpfully suggests that you voice your support for Taiwan in their community forum. But‚Äîah, plot twist‚Äîmaking a forum account requires Deezer access, and we already know (please repeat with me): Deezer is not available in your country.

But aha! You‚Äôre a master of MP3, FLAC and BIOS config files, surely you can install a free VPN to get around this. Lo and behold, it works. You finally make your account and post in the forum. A week later, a reply!

https://preview.redd.it/z218a1tcv3xd1.png?width=1691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeac5927901b8535092751f1a9d09530b7e4ef22

Awesome! They understand how important it is for you to have access to (and pay for) their services.

Then, all hope is not lost. Maybe Taiwan can eventually join the club of the top 95% of countries that have access to Deezer.

If you want to speed things up, fire up your VPN or your remote working RDP server and voice your support in this thread:

[Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1cqot8e/foreign_national_here_born_abroad_outside_taiwan/) which I need to be in Taiwan around 2-3 weeks.

However, currently my mom's household registration is expired. Our plan is for her to go first to Taiwan to recover her household registration, and then for me to be added onto it.  My question is, how long it takes for my mom to recover her household registration first?  Wondering how long we should plan for between when she arrives and I arrive.

We just have no idea if this process takes just days, months, or something in-between. My mom has lived outside of Taiwan for over 40 years now, so she is less sure about how long these government processes take, and how to find out.

my question is, if ROC is the recognized country to Taiwan, when did it reclaim the citizenship of mainland Chinese? in case you forgot, there're still many elder Chinese who were born before PRC was established. also, is it possible to do so?

And, per my knowledge of the ROC constitution, the mainland is part of the ROC territory, when did it give it up formally? why do people behave like ROC equals to Taiwan?

Or is it that Taiwanese actually don't care about ROC, it's just a way of avoiding bothering CCP?

These question might sound unusual to Taiwanese people, but I've had them for a long time as a mainlander.

277,"TSMC‚Äôs Arizona Chip Production Yields Surpass Taiwan‚Äôs in Win for US Push
","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has achieved early production yields at its first plant in Arizona that surpass similar factories back home, a significant breakthrough for a US expansion project initially dogged by delays and worker strife.

The share of chips manufactured at TSMC‚Äôs facility in Phoenix that are usable is about 4 percentage points higher than comparable facilities in Taiwan, Rick Cassidy, president of TSMC‚Äôs US division, told listeners on a webinar Wednesday, according to a person who participated. The success rate, or yield, is a critical measure in the semiconductor industry because it determines whether companies will be able to cover the enormous costs of a chip plant.

The accomplishment is a sign of progress for Washington‚Äôs efforts to revitalize American semiconductor manufacturing. TSMC, the main chip manufacturing partner for Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc., is in line to win $6.6 billion in government grants and $5 billion in loans ‚Äî plus 25% tax credits ‚Äî to build three fabrication facilities, or fabs, in Arizona. The award, like almost all others from the 2022 Chips and Science Act, isn‚Äôt yet finalized.

A TSMC spokesperson declined to comment directly on Cassidy‚Äôs event and referred to remarks from Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei on a call with investors last week.

‚ÄúOur first fab entered engineering wafer production in April with 4-nanometer process technology, and the result is highly satisfactory, with a very good yield,‚Äù he said at the time. ‚ÄúThis is an important operational milestone for TSMC and our customers, demonstrating TSMC‚Äôs strong manufacturing capability and execution.‚Äù

The two other chipmakers at the heart of the Biden administration‚Äôs tech strategy, Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co., have struggled in recent months. Intel, slated to be the biggest beneficiary of the Chips Act, is under such severe financial pressure that it‚Äôs delaying global projects and considering selling off assets.

TSMC, meanwhile, has been on a roll. Its shares reached a record high this month after the chipmaker topped quarterly estimates and raised its target for 2024 revenue growth.

The latest yield advancement is notable for TSMC because it has historically kept the most advanced and efficient plants in its home island of Taiwan. Its Arizona site got off to a rocky start, as the company couldn‚Äôt find enough skilled staff to install advanced equipment and workers struggled with safety and management issues. TSMC reached an accord with construction labor unions late last year.

The chipmaker originally planned to have its first Arizona plant start full production in 2024, but pushed back the target to 2025 over the labor issues. It later delayed the start date for its second fab to 2027 or 2028, from an initial target of 2026. That fueled concerns that the company might not be able to make chips in the US as efficiently as in Taiwan.

TSMC could now be keen to expand its US presence further, depending in part on the possibility of more government backing, Cassidy added, citing early conversations in Washington about a second Chips Act. There is room for at least six total fabs at the Phoenix complex.

Wei conveyed optimism about the US push during the call last week.
‚ÄúWe now expect volume production of our first fab to start in the beginning of 2025, and are confident to deliver the same level of manufacturing quality and reliability from our fab in Arizona as from our fabs in Taiwan,‚Äù he said.",https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1gbrhbf/tsmcs_arizona_chip_production_yields_surpass/,self.taiwan,2024-10-25 11:56:13,MorningHerald,2024-10-25
278,Honest Thoughts About US,"My Background: I'm an ABC who lived in America for 12 years, went to high school in the mainland for international school, and am not back in the US for college. My parents are very indifferent to the CCP and most of the time even view the government somewhat negatively.

As a US citizen who reads tons of FOIA where we totally fuck over nations that don't really deserve it because of ""freedom"" and ""liberty"", I wanted to know what Taiwanese people actually think of my country. Since from my perspective, I kind of like the fact that Taiwan is in sort of a limbo zone not controlled by the US or Mainland China? This is because I believe that Taiwan has always been sort of a separate area thats been technically under China since the Qing dynasty but with really little control over the region. At the same time however, if Taiwan were to become independent, to me, it would feel like a form of modern imperialism as it would be a bit too close for comfort to the US for geo-political reasons.

Obviously I don't really have a full perspective on the situation and wanted to have a discussion with people who would skew more towards the an independent Taiwan perspective to go out of my own circle.

1. Two identical standard passport photos in color.
2. Work Permit Print in color¬†
3. Study Permit Print in colour

1. **MAIN QUESTION.**  **Does embassy collect passport for 5-10 days and issue a sticker visa in the passport** or they don't?  Or embassy does not collect passport and I will get entry sticker at the airport in Taipei?
2. If I have Chinese transit stamp and sticker, issued in Shanghai Pudong, can this impact my Taiwanese visa application?
3. If I get Taiwanese visa now and in the future I would like to apply for Chinese multiple visa-entry, China can deny my application?

333,So many abandoned buildings,"So I‚Äôm wrapping up a 15-day trip to Taiwan and have had an amazing time (me, typical American ËÄÅÂ§ñÔºõwife, from Shandong, but she‚Äôs been here before, we both live in US), we rented a car and drove down the west coast, hit Taichung, then into the mountains for sun moon lake and Alishan, then down to Kaohsiung and Kenting. Then back up the east coast along the coast taking the ocean road path, stopping at several interesting and scenic spots, Hualien, Yilan, Keelung, and finally to Taipei where we dropped the car. 

This kind of road trip was amazing to me, I love driving and the mountain roads are exciting and I like that we saw so many things even if we didn‚Äôt stay in one place more than 1-2 days. But one thing that kind of stuck with me almost everywhere we went was the large amounts of abandoned buildings or areas. Pretty much Taipei is the first place that it hasn‚Äôt been as prevalent or apparent (to me at least). I don‚Äôt just mean ‚Äòvacant‚Äô, i mean it looks like a scene out of the walking dead with large amounts of over growth, like it‚Äôs been vacant for years and years. Is there something driving this in particular (people moving to cities, developers abandoning half started projects, etc)? Or am I just being ignorant to something else? Or maybe my perspective is just skewed since I saw more rural areas than urban throughout the trip.  

Some examples are several Airbnb type buildings in Kenting right near the beach that even had its own garage entrance, some building right near the Tropic of Cancer marker on the east coast which looked like it‚Äôs supposed to be like a gift shop, yet totally barren. Another place I saw a whole motorcycle like literally 1ft away from a walking path just abandoned and covered in brush (no one would even want parts?).

342, Computer Science Master (English) in Taiwan Advice ,"I am interested in pursuing an English Computer Science Master degree in Taiwan. Currently, I have already been working as a software engineer in my home country in Germany for 3 years. I already travelled to Taiwan and liked it a lot. As I want to stay there for an extended period of time, I though pursuing a Master degree would be a good option to move there, while still doing something for my CV. Learning (more) Chinese is also an important goal for me. Since I will probably get my job back after returning to Germany I do not care about rankings that much.

Does someone have experience with studying Computer Science in Taiwan in English? I did not find many experiences online. I just heard that apparently English courses are sometimes not really in English (materials in English but lecture in Chinese), which makes me a bit worried.

I found a few programs in English.

* [NTU](https://www.ceecs.ntust.edu.tw/p/412-1001-7632.php?Lang=en): They list ""Chinese proficiency certificate at CEFR (A2 or above)"" as recommended language skill. It is not mandatory, and they also not require an official certificate, just ""If you are unable to provide any of the documents above, please provide a statement of how you are going to improve your Chinese skills if you are admitted (maximum 500 words)."" So probably that's a sign, that the English courses may not be 100 % in English. I had already three Chinese courses in Germany and learned lot on my own. So I could probably reach A2 by then. However, I highly doubt that A2 would be nearly enough to understand lectures.
* NTUST (Taiwan Tech): I heard that the Taiwan Tech is more international than the NTU. On the other hand the selection of graduate courses in English is quite limited (for some reason they have more English undergrad courses). Apparently it may be possible to get credits from other departments as well, but it will be probably difficult to find enough interesting courses.
* NTNU: Similar as Taiwan Tech, not that many courses.

Does someone have experience with studying CS in on the these schools and could share some experiences? üôè",https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1g9uwnd/computer_science_master_english_in_taiwan_advice/,self.taiwan,2024-10-22 23:24:30,GarlicOnion12,2024-10-22

I'm all for equality, super glad that female and LGBTQ movement have been progressing. 

Not saying everyone should get drafted, but everyone should have equal opportunity of choice. 

I've been screwed over by this and set back my life goals by years. Now that recalls happen freqently, it's even more frustrating. 

As generally a physical weaker male, I hate to get assumed that I should be tough and strong in that matter. Along with minor germaphobia, wanting to stay clean gets labeled as ""unmanly""

Whenever I brought this up, always get hit by the ""well, women have to bear children"". Yes, it is its own social pressure, but it's not illegal to not have children. 

--

When 4 month conscription was still active (for the record, I served 1 year), I kept hearing, ""We're training a bunch of sissys"" ""The country is doomed with no real soldiers"" ""Should extend back to 1+ year"". 

I understand old folksand those who served 2-3 years making the statement. But the rest who are still eligible to join the army? Please join as you don't have choice since you don't value other people having choices. We should be pointing our finger towards the governments (yes, with s) on resulting such policies.

I did not choose to be born here, and there are better and worse places to be in. I wish a handful of people like me can give opinions on this without being labeled as unmanly or unpatriotic.

A mate of mine has just had a baby in Taiwan, and I wanted to get him a baby gift, but I‚Äôm finding the whole online shopping for Taiwan thing really difficult.

For context, I'm writing from Australia, and I don't speak/write chinese - or know anyone here who does.

I asked him about online shops, and he said a lot of people use things like Shopee, Momo etc  
But these websites just don‚Äôt translate at all, or not really well enough (some translate half the page only).

I‚Äôve heard that you might need Taiwanese govt/citizenship/address/phone details etc to register to buy things (which I clearly don‚Äôt have).

I just want to buy something from a big well known online shopping site which locals would normally use, so that I can get it delivered there easily, and affordably (rather than me shipping stuff from Australia - as that would severely limit what I can send etc).

There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a Taiwanese Amazon which I find strange‚Ä¶

[Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) (US version) is looking like the best option so far, though it has no Prime Option, and a VERY Limited list of items on offer compared to a normal Amazon site.

I'm told the Japanese Amazon has a similarly limited range on offer too.  Does anyone know which of those two is better for range,  and prices (including shipping) ?



Though, I'd still love to find something better; as the shipping is still horrendous.

Even a small pack of envelopes costs AUD $20.00 to ship ?

You have to get over AUD $90 for free shipping, otherwise a AUD $25 item costs AUD $30 to ship etc.  
I wasn't necessarily planning on spending that much as I'm not buying with others.

At least it's in english though.

Can anyone help me out here with some detailed advice on what to do?  
I don‚Äôt want to have to ask my mate to use his account; as that will kind of spoil the surprise etc.

I had also thought of sending him credit via a gift card or something, and telling him to buy ‚Äòthis item‚Äô, but that‚Äôs even worse.

386,Allergic to Sesam,"Hello everyone, I came hear for searching some help. I am hopeful to find it here. Two years ago I found out through doctor and diagnosis that I am having a allergy against sesam. Reason for that was my trouble for breathing while eating a handfull in Onigiri, I always ate everything and never had to watch out so I thought. Because of my trouble of breathing I went through a lot of investigation and ended up in a allergy test. At that same time I met my partner which is Taiwanese. I am having a sesam allergy with trouble of breathing, so I avoided sesam and therefore the food containing it, which is already hard, because I actually liked sesam. But my issues vanished. Beside that the doctor also figured out I am allergic to soybean (soysauce seems to be ok and my symptomes are stomage issues) and I also always ate asian food. I am sad already, it's really hard to not eat that what I like. So the question I want to ask, if I visit Taiwan, because now I am with my partner since a while, is eating outside a real problem? 
Are there any dishes which don't need sesam seeds or sesam √∂l? 
I know it is always on the package of a product, if it can contain sesam. My partner said they have to ad it, but he wasn't able to travel to Taiwan and really able to tell me if sesam is avoidable or not. Which I understand, because if you are not allergic you don't really care or watch out that badly. 
I imagine it is hard to avoid both. So living there is connected to cooking by myself that I know, but never eating outside that is a hard task. 
So if going to be there for a month or weeks I at least would like to know, if possible or not and if to bring my own food when eating outside.

414,My sister told me I became a ‚Äòwilling prey‚Äô,"Last week I was strolling through a park in Taipei when a local man stopped me. He asked if I could help with his project, assuring me it would only take a short time. As everyone I‚Äôd encountered in the city had been so friendly, my usual caution went away. My mind automatically assumed it was for some university assignment, so I agreed. 

At first, the instructions seemed harmless. He had me walk, make small hops, and move in circles. It felt almost playful, but then he asked to film my feet. That‚Äôs when a sense of unease began to settle in. I foolishly brushed it aside, convincing myself it was still part of the project.

My sister told me I became a willing prey. Now that it‚Äôs all over, I do agree and can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I might have become a willing participant in something I didn‚Äôt fully grasp. The thought of being involved with someone who may have had a foot fetish makes me uncomfortable. It‚Äôs unsettling to think I completely let my guard down but maybe it‚Äôs because this place felt so welcoming. I am also mad at myself for not even asking for his portfolio in the first place.

2. Is it just me or does this song just hit you in the heart on landing (and I do mean like a spear)? My flight is 14 hours, it‚Äôs so touching and otherworldly but also so familiar. I almost feel like flights landing in Taiwan should be required to play it because it‚Äôs such a ‚Äúcultural boon‚Äù of a tune. United‚Äôs landing music has nothing on this song‚Äôs motherly tone, desperate to hug you home.

For those unfamiliar, the song itself was created in Taiwan during the Japanese occupation period originally a children‚Äôs song, then later changed to have words related to a very sad story about a woman (it‚Äôs long you can look at the wiki) but more impressive the song was later adapted in world war 2 to be a wartime song for the Japanese war effort, then later when the ROC government came to Taiwan the song was banned from being played or sung during martial law period.

418,How desillusioned am I to think about moving to Taiwan ? My profile ,"Hello fellow redditors, 

Could you please tell me what arey chances of finding a job for 3months or longer in Taiwan? 

My profile 
- around 25 male, brown skin 
- master's degree in public affairs
- eu-native, mother tongues from 2 big European countries, used English as a working language, mandarin around HSK5 (ÊôÆÈÄöËØù though, right now I struggle with traditional characters) 
- few professional experiences: lots of unemployement, internships in civil society organizations in the European Union and start-ups in Beijing


A few questions please 
- how realistic is it to find a job in Taiwan linked to sustainability and/or public affairs/policy ? How much time would I need to find such a job if I am already in Taiwan versus if I am searching from abroad ? 
- same question than above, but now with whatever job is able to pay my bills and ideally slave 250 euros a month ? I would be okay with washing dishes or helping companies grab EU market shares
- Working holiday visa seemed a good idea at first glance, but does not seem popular on this reddit hahaha why? Would a company not be able to easily hire me if I already have a work visa? 
- how much savings would I need before I find a job which covers my bills ? 

My goal is simply to improve my mandarin and avoid any debts ! I am flexible regarding location and very adaptable to new environments

Lots of people have been recommended to teach English, but I guess it won't be an option for me since I am not from an English native country and not white enough and... I don't mind, if would actually prefer a job where I can avoid foreigners to actively practice mandarin 


Any other tips are also super welcome, thanks a lot !

I'm into local craft markets, jazz bars, techno, art workshops, pop ups, and things that are usually 'one off' events, quite difficult to find if you don't know the 'cool' people from the city you're visiting. \*It would be much appreciated if anyone can recommend some cool influencers to follow on ig so I can start looking.

425,Short Change Ripoff in Taiwan. Not.,"I've lived in Taiwan for 34 years now, and have had thousands of transactions. Been both short-, and long-changed. A few dozen times each. And I always straighten things out as soon as I notice, no matter which. We're all human here; mistakes get made, but in general, Taiwanese people strike me as VERY honest. 

I've been ripped off deliberately twice. Once by a woman selling fragrant flowers at the stop light. I wanted one garland, but she pretended I wanted two and made change appropriately. So I got fucked for one garland. Probably NT$20. I was furious of course. So I struck back. Never bought from those ladies again, canceling thousands of NT$ worth of sales over the years. I really hurt em! 

And I got ripped once by a taxi. He failed to start the meter. I knew how much that trip should cost, but he overcharged.  Total rip off amount (flowers plus taxi) comes to about NT$60. About NT$ 0.005 per day, on average.

Up until this year, honest errors were about evenly divided‚Äîhalf in my favor and half in my disfavor, which makes me think they are honest errors. If they were all against me, I'd have a less pleasant opinion.

But about a month ago there was a bigger error. I bought a scroll saw from a Taiwan vendor, online, COD. Total cost NT$5410. Saw was delivered promptly through the mail, but no one collected. Free saw! I contacted the seller and asked for ATM payment details. Vendor replied with details, and thanked me for my honesty. 

He also said since I was so honest, I could knock NT$10 off the total. Which I did. So I now have a dollar value assigned to my honesty: NT$10, which is 32¬¢. Good to know. Anyway, this NT$5400 error in my favor has thrown my mental balance sheet off and the Taiwanese are now ***way ahead.***",https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1g76m6y/short_change_ripoff_in_taiwan_not/,self.taiwan,2024-10-19 12:13:45,wheezer72,2024-10-19

453,What species does this monstruosity belong to,"( setting the post as NSFW as you might not want this to show up on your feed lol ).

Hi guys, question here.

In lived in Asia for 10 years including almost 8 in Ta√Øwan. I usually never have pest issues until this morning. I went for a t-shirt and this beast the size of a thumb escaped from one of my shirt sleeve.

I never had any big roach in my studio for the 5 years I lived there. I just saw a similar one, dead, lying on my floor when I came back from holidays few months ago ( I left a bunch of poisoned food roach trap  everywhere in the studio before going to holidays ).

I know how to deal with these guys and my place is clean and well isolated ( like they can't come from the shower or the bathroom sink except if they are incredibly small ). I also don't have kitchen and don't cook home, and there is no leftovers.

But I have a question: what is this exactly ?
- Is this an American roach nymph ( as he has no or little wings, a white collar and a darkish color ) in which case he might have come from the balcony when I left the door open or from a sink when he was much smaller
- Or is it another one, like the oriental cockroach, in which case I would search for egg sacks and take this more seriously ?

There was some roach poop where he was so I cleaned everything and put all the clothes around to the washing machine. There was no fool smell. I not so scared but I want these to stay far away from my place for safety reasons, even if I know in Asia that's something you must live with.

Thanks in advance !

455,Medical student working in surgery for 1 month. What city to choose?,"Hi!

I‚Äôm a swedish medical student (22M) going to Taiwan for 1 month for an internship in some kind of surgery. I can chose 1 of 3 cities. The cities being:

- Taichung 
- Kaohsiung
- Taoyuan 

I as a person do enjoy going out and doing city things. I grew up in a village so I really don‚Äôt care about nature etc anymore. What city do you guys recommend?
Please also consider I will be working in the city and not just running around being a tourist, even though I will only work like 32h a week and weekends off, it is important that I can get around easily in the city no matter if it‚Äôs late etc. But from what I understand all cities are good for this.

I'm heading to Taipei this weekend for a day on Saturday and I want to stay overnight at a internet cafe and then head back home on Sunday evening. There's an internet cafe called Lee Hwa Hang which seems to be recommended by this subreddit in the past, so I want to give this a try.

1) How do I make a reservation in advance for two people?

There's an official [website](https://inline.app/booking/ecoffee/ecoffee), but it's mostly in Chinese and I don't understand the rules and guidelines. I'm assuming for two people overnight, I need to pick Èõô‰∫∫ÂåÖÂªÇÔºàË´ãÈÅ∏ÂÖ©‰ΩçÈ†êÁ¥Ñ) option for a private/VIP room? And the price would be 600 NTD per person or in total?

2) How is the accommodation/amenities here?

The pictures on the website don't show much of the room, and I couldn't find a lot of YouTube videos covering this. Is there's a bed or a mattress inside the private room? Is there a shower, lockers? How much do they cost?

3) Are there any other 24h internet cafes that offers private, overnight stays?

I know about QTime, but I couldn't find a website for this place, so I'm assuming I would need to go in person.

4) If you've been to Lee Hwa Hang before, what is your experience?

481,"recommend a city to live in, hoping for good air quality + access to good dental care","my partner and I are looking at moving to Taiwan for a year and hoping for some feedback on the pros/cons of various cities. we did spend a few weeks travelling in Taiwan, but obviously living there is different. 

We're Canadian and neither have dental coverage, so the plan/goal is to move to Taiwan for a year to get all the dental work we need done, as well as enjoy a break from Canada/winter and explore Taiwan more.  

We're most keen for somewhere with good air quality and access to good dental care. Having some nature/hikes nearby would be amazing, too. Not opposed to the rainier weather in the north, or the very hot south.

Taipei seems a bit too hectic/expensive for us, but Keelung nearby looks pretty great? Is it nice to live in that region, or a bit overtaken by tourists?

We didn't make it to some of the bigger cities on the west coast like Taoyuan and Hsinchu, but they seem a bit hectic and we're wondering if the air quality would be quite poor? 

Yunlin county, Chiayi county and Changhua¬†county all look really beautiful, but Im wondering what it's like to live there? Is the dental care as good in the smaller cities as the main ones? 

Kaohsiung seems pretty perfect for what we're looking for, but my partner has a very involved aunt who lives there, and TBH she manages to be very overbearing even when across the ocean, so we're kinda keen to avoid Kaohsiung so we dont have her dropping by every day lol, as helpful as it would be to know someone in the city lol  

Leaning away from Tainan due to the crazy driving, and from the east coast as it seems tougher/slower to get to and from, if we want to do any travelling. 

Partner works online and has flexibility with location, and I work with kids, so would be looking for a job as an English teacher at a language school. I worked as one in Korea a number of years ago, so am familiar with the role and hope that experience would mean  I'd have success finding one in Taiwan. but I know ESL teaching jobs in the smaller cities/regions might be limited

Unfortunately for me, Airbnb has the exact type of place we‚Äôre looking for, suitable for the three of us. So, my question is: What are the real risks? Is the traveler at risk, or only the host?

498,I‚Äôm curious about learning survival skills ,"So in Canada I was blessed to be informally adopted into a Native family and have learned general survival techniques for temperate woodland environments. 

I taught wilderness survival back home. 

I would love to learn survival skills in Taiwan, which is an entirely alien environment for me. 

I‚Äôm an outsider, I‚Äôm not asking for deep spiritual/cultural knowledge or anything. I just want to learn how to survive in this environment. I have a massive respect for Indigenous peoples and I never want to overstep my boundaries. 

I know this is a long shot, but if anyone knows people who practice traditional hunting and gathering, and traditional medicine gathering, I‚Äôd love to speak to them. 

I‚Äôm not trying to go out and market myself as some guru bullshit. I have ADHD and I can barely get my normal day together. My apartment is a goddamn disaster because I‚Äôm fucked. I just want to learn and help and teach, that‚Äôs all. 

Like hello, I‚Äôm a fucking ADHD disaster. I have many interests and my brain pursues all of them at the same time. I‚Äôm three raccoons in a trench coat arguing the same shit from different angles. 

All of this to say I‚Äôm not trying to culturally appropriate. I do not have the braincells to do that. I would love to learn about survival in Taiwan and actual plant ID. I think that knowledge would be wonderful but I also understand it‚Äôs not mine. So I would be joyful for whatever knowledge I am given!

513,Is Alishan Mountain worth visiting after waiting for 12 years?,"I was born in the United States but moved to Taiwan when I was five and lived there for six years. During that time, I traveled to many parts of Taiwan but never made it to Alishan Mountain. When I started middle school, my family and I moved back to the United States, where we‚Äôve lived ever since.

Over the years, we‚Äôve visited Taiwan several times, usually during summer or Christmas breaks. Despite my desire to visit Alishan Mountain, other plans always took priority, pushing that trip down the list.

In the summer of 2012, during a family trip to Taiwan when I was in high school, we finally planned to visit Alishan Mountain. My parents had been there in the 1980s before I was born, but they didn‚Äôt remember much about it, so we booked a tour with a travel agency in Taipei. Everything was set‚Äîuntil Typhoon Saola hit Taiwan, disrupting the entire transportation system. At first, the agency insisted on preparing for the trip, even as warnings about the typhoon intensified. My family fought to cancel the tour and get a refund. After multiple trips to the agency, we only managed to recover 85% of the cost. Since our return flight back to the United States was approaching, rescheduling wasn‚Äôt an option. In the end, it felt like a waste of time and money.

Ever since it‚Äôs become a running joke among friends: ‚ÄúYou lived in Taiwan for six years and still haven‚Äôt been to Alishan Mountain?‚Äù The running joke got so bad that I got sick and tired of hearing about the attraction.

On subsequent trips to Taiwan, I kept suggesting we revive the plan to visit Alishan, but other destinations always took precedence:

- December 2013: Kinmen, Taiwan
- December 2014: Shanghai, China, and Hong Kong
- January 2017: Japan
- January 2018: South Korea and Japan
- May 2019: Too busy to travel

Then, COVID-19 hit, and our trips to Taiwan were put on hold for over four years. Now, I‚Äôm approaching 30, and last month, my family suggested a month-long trip to Taiwan in December, with stops in Beijing and Hong Kong. I reluctantly agreed because my career situation has changed significantly.

I‚Äôve waited over 12 years to visit Alishan Mountain, but the excitement has faded. The constant jokes about me never making it there haven‚Äôt stopped either. For the first time, my family wants to take me to Alishan this December, but after all the humiliation and delays, I‚Äôve decided I don‚Äôt want to go anymore. This decision permanently disappointed my family.

Is Alishan Mountain even worth the visit at this point? Do I deserve to go after all this time?",https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1g3yx2h/is_alishan_mountain_worth_visiting_after_waiting/,self.taiwan,2024-10-15 04:45:11,TheFabLeoWang,2024-10-15

6. Obligatory political drama where characters fight in local election for some political position (I don't know much about Taiwanese politics)

7. Obligatory kidnapping scene (Usually related to the romantic drama, some important character sacrifice may occur)

8. Main characters will disappear in the middle of the show for some reason while the drama needlessly deviates to side story focusing on side characters for WAY too long, main characters will only return near the end of the show

9. Characters crying in pain in the middle of the road during rainstorm after going through breakup

10. The show takes at least 2 years to finish broadcasting even with daily broadcast

537,How do you deal with people giving your kid candy or gifts during tantrums?,"Was just chatting with my husband (Taiwanese) about back when my(American) son (from previous marriage) was little, since we're currently 36wks pregnant with my husband's first. 

I told him one of the things that stressed me out was dealing with people shoving candy in my kid's face if he had a tantrum in public. When I mentioned that I would often tell the grandma/grandpa (it was always some elderly person doing it) that we didn't want their candy, or tell them to stop and let me handle things on my own if they kept insisting, my husband got upset. He feels the elderly people are just trying to help.

I mentioned that I understand they ""just want to help"", but that they are just making things more difficult in the long run by teaching that getting angry gets you things, and that what I say doesn't matter. Hearing this, my husband decided I was being a ""bitchy American"" and complained that we westerners shouldn't come to Taiwan and be aggressive to elders. However, my ex, from Kinmen, would also tell the elderly people trying to give candy to our son to go away. 

So, if you are Taiwanese, how do you react in such a situation, and would you feel differently seeing a westerner rejecting help from the elderly Vs a Taiwanese doing it?

586,Criticized as most congested city in Taiwan... This is how Taichung Government responded,"[https://udn.com/news/story/7325/8287161](https://udn.com/news/story/7325/8287161)

&gt;ChatGPT translation:

&gt;Dutch navigation system manufacturer TomTom has released the 2023 **Global Traffic Index rankings, placing Taichung as the 4th most congested city in Asia and the most congested in Taiwan.** City councilors criticized the negative publicity, saying it brought shame to Taichung on the international stage. The city government responded that it will take the report into account for traffic management and will actively promote the metro system.

&gt;**The Taichung Transportation Bureau responded** that the indicators in TomTom's global traffic congestion index report mainly come from data analysis of vehicles using the company‚Äôs navigation software while traveling on all roads in Taichung, including highways and expressways. **The data indirectly reflects Taichung‚Äôs rapid development**, which has attracted a large volume of traffic and led to congestion problems, highlighting the necessity of metro construction in the city.

&gt;In the rankings for the most congested cities in Asia, three cities from Taiwan made it into the top 10: Taichung ranked 4th, Kaohsiung 6th, and Tainan 10th, while the capital city Taipei came in 11th.

&gt;City councilor Jiang Zhaoguo criticized the fact that Taichung ranked 4th worst in Asia, just behind Bangalore and Pune in India, and Manila in the Philippines, making it the worst city in Taiwan for traffic. He added that this ""negative publicity"" has made its way onto the international stage, which is unacceptable for the citizens of Taichung and will likely worsen the city's tourism.

&gt;Jiang also criticized the Taichung city government for multiple traffic accidents in recent years, such as a crane arm hitting a metro train and a bus colliding with a pedestrian. Now, even road congestion is being singled out. He called the city government incompetent and unreflective, accusing them of copying reports from two years ago. Despite numerous traffic incidents and casualties, the head of the Transportation Bureau has not been asked to step down, leaving citizens to suffer.

&gt;The Transportation Bureau pointed out that last year, several major construction projects, such as the connection of National Highway No. 1 to the Taichung Ring Expressway (Route 74), affected road traffic efficiency in the surrounding areas. However, after the opening of the Daya System Interchange on National Highway No. 1 this year, traffic pressure has been significantly reduced, and congestion on Zhongqing Road and Huan-Zhong Road has noticeably improved. For Route 74 and key interchange areas that experience heavy traffic during peak hours, the city will reference the data from TomTom‚Äôs report to enhance traffic management.

  
I wasn't planning to post the congestion ranking here as there was nothing unexpected and a similar result can be seen from last year's ranking released by the same company. And that's when I saw the Taichung government made the following reply, 'Congestion shows that the city is booming with business.' So, not only are they not ashamed of their absolute incompetence of not being able to design any safe and efficient roads whatsoever, they are in fact proud of the status quo? Taiwanese people can be car brained sometimes, but this level of arrogance and ignorance is mind boggling. I think this comment says a lot about why Taichung has been lagging behind other Taiwanese cities in terms of transportation safety and efficiency. And that is because they see no problem with it.

  
ps. I translated the title myself and I tried to make it more natural and readable in English. The full literal original title in English would be ""Taichung, ranked as the most congested city in Taiwan, has faced criticism for bringing shame to the city. In response, the city government has issued a statement.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1g1wwrr/criticized_as_most_congested_city_in_taiwan_this/,self.taiwan,2024-10-12 11:05:59,taiwanboy10,2024-10-12

Go to a clinic and tell them you want an abortion. Pay the money and they will give you the medication.  They are required by law to watch you take the medication in their presence.  

If it is a late stage abortion, you will have to go to a public medical center, not any medical center will be able to assist with a late stage abortion.  Only the Public Medical Centers are equipped to assist.

I have a dual citizenship (Palestine), but due to ongoing war and its weak passport strength I just let it expire, if I could somehow renew it will it help me?

Im 22 years old, I heard there‚Äôs service for 4 months?  But then now there‚Äôs 1 for 1 year?  I can‚Äôt really fit 4 months between university years as I‚Äôm in medical school and I genuinely don‚Äôt have time as I‚Äôm always studying.

605,Why Taiwan Matters to the US and the World,"China‚Äôs menacing behavior toward Taiwan should terrify the international community. First, the island is indispensable for world‚Äôs tech industry, and according to a Bloomberg Economics estimate, a Chinese blockade of Taiwan could cost the global economy $10 trillion‚Äîabout 10 percent of global GDP. Second, a conflict over Taiwan would create geopolitical fallout, and a Chinese victory would upend the current world order. Lastly, Taiwanese freedom matters, and the example of Asia‚Äôs top-ranked democracy would be lost if Beijing coerced 23 million Taiwanese into servitude. The United States therefore needs to create layers of deterrence among democratic allies and partners to deter China.

629,Questions about Thai Massages in Taiwan,"So, I feel a bit silly and awkward asking this, but I need to know if this is usual. 

I went to get a massage today and found that the closest place to me does Thai massage. My thoughts were that that type is fully clothed, but the lady had me get completely undressed. Was that supposed to happen? There were these little mesh see-through undies, I guess, but they didn't feel like much by way of modesty-preservation. Why couldn't I have worn my own underwear?

Anyway, my main concerns have to do with the fact that she came in while I was in the process of undressing, smiled, and then just stood there staring at me while I took my bra off and tried to get covered. She also kept pulling down or pushing up those undies depending on what part of me she was working on. Her hands were often on my behind. Once I was on my back, she flipped back the towel and bared each breast multiple times while working on my arms and inner shoulders. I felt startled and uncomfortable, but she just laughed like I was being silly by continually trying to put the towel back in place. A couple of times, she brushed her fingertips over my labia. 

My main question is, was that a normal experience? I don't think I'll want to do that again if so.",https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1g0nk5j/questions_about_thai_massages_in_taiwan/,self.taiwan,2024-10-10 17:59:38,ShadLad224,2024-10-10

647,International Driving License recognition,"Basically my question is how does International Driving License (IDL) recognition work in Taiwan.

I have done some research, been to Motor Vehicle Office but I still have not been able to completely understand it and I do not want to get myself into any trouble.

To make things clear, I am a student from Czech Republic currently in Taiwan for an exchange stay. I have got a driving license stating the vehicles I can drive, being **B** (car no heavier than 3,5t) and **AM** (50cc engine motorcycle). In Czechia I received IDL according to **1949 Geneva Convention** which should be recognized in Taiwan (although I have not been able to find any reliable source stating that). I know that here in Taiwan I can use it for one month and then I need to obtain International Driving Permit (IDP). So I have been here for a month and I decided to get the permit so I can maybe try riding a scooter. Everything went smooth, I got the permit without any problems but when I asked what vehicles I am allowed to drive with the class of permit they gave me, the staff said that I can only drive a car here in Taiwan and that they **do not recognize my AM permit here**. Which seemed weird to me because I thought that signatories of the Geneva Convention are supposed to recognize all types of permits in the IDL. However, it gets even more confusing to me as the IDP states that the **Class of IDP is A-ÊôÆÂ∞è**. I have been told that the Chinese characters mean something like general small, but the main thing is that according to the IDL, A stands for motorcycles.

I attached pictures so you can see yourselves.

654,Quick Methods of Getting Cash? Only brought credit cards and Discover Debit Card. ,"Hello all,

I‚Äôm hoping you all could help. I did this really dumb thing of just brining my Discover debit card and credit cards. I know it was dumb to just bring one debit card and have that one debit card be a Discover one. 

When I call their customer service weeks ago, they assured me that so long as I can find ATM that accepts Discover I can withdraw cash  I have my Discover credit card, Chase Sapphire Premier and Citi Strata credit cards.  

I tried using the ATM machines from the TenShin bank (not their actual bank location, only at FamilyMart) and was unsuccessful. My second option was to get a WesternUnion wire transfer, but I didn‚Äôt realize it would take multiple days and today is a national holiday so all the banks are closed. When I called Discover today, they said that their debit card only works in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 

I don‚Äôt have any friends or relatives in Taiwan, who I can Venmo or Cash app to and they can give me cash in return. 

If you have any suggestions, please let me know. Thank you so much. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1g06ypb/quick_methods_of_getting_cash_only_brought_credit/,self.taiwan,2024-10-10 01:51:32,multiequations,2024-10-10

658,Need serious help mentally and academically ,"I was an int‚Äôl student in the U.S., but due to mental issues transferred back to my home country to keep on doing my bachelor degree.

The decision of studying aboard initially was unforgivably hasty, but it‚Äôs the only choice I know with the knowledge/resources I had at that time. I did not enjoy the city and environment, which got me depressed. It became worse, I realized I have to stop, so I transferred back to my home country.

After transferring back, I discovered my fiercely-burning interest in comp neuro. 
Also my vision got wide enough to found that it was the location, school, and the first time being in a foreign country that got me depressed and frustrated. Plus I developed serious elite school complex, so now the school in Taiwan couldn‚Äôt satisfy me (I have a feeling that no matter how good the grad school I end up being, this bachelor will follow me forever), also on the reality perspective, it indeed would have me seem one point worse than other applicants in future grad school applications.
So I‚Äôm considering transferring back to the U.S., to a school with wisely picked location and at least decent reputation in neuro.
However I am also worried that the two times transfer will just be my criminal record, which might also affects grad school application. 

I‚Äôm in a position where I cannot move forward nor backward, I understand the above description might make me seemed immature, clueless and irritating.
But I do seriously need help, psychological support and academic pathway counseling at the same time. To my knowledge there isn‚Äôt a therapist that could do both, so if you are/you know someone that happens to be familiar with undergrad system in the U.S., do neuro research, and knows how to settle one‚Äôs mind, I would be greatly, greatly appreciated your help, please pm or comment or pm for my Gmail.

Now that revolut has changed its fees, I'm looking for a better way to transfer money. From research it looks like Wise is best for transfers under 5k. I've read some things about IKBR but am relatively unfamiliar with them.

726,Experiences living in a share house in Taipei,"I'm a student coming to study Mandarin in Taipei this winter and while I was looking for housing, it seems like many international students choose to stay in shared apartments. Most of which are independently run through private landlords that can be found via MyRoomAbroad or Facebook groups. 

I don't think that I want to live completely alone with this being my first time abroad, but I've also never lived in share houses before. I'm actually a pretty shy, introverted person who wants to meet new people/make friends abroad but at the same time really values privacy. So the prospect of moving in with a bunch of complete strangers and having no control over who I live with kind of scares me.

When you contract with private landlords for rooms in shared apartments:

1. Who is responsible for setting the rules, regulations, and expectations of tenants in the apartment (noise, having people over, cleanliness)?
2. Who is responsible for getting common-use items such as toilet paper and hand soap for the shared bathroom and detergent for the washing machine, or maybe paper towels/dish soap for the kitchen (though I doubt it gets used a lot since eating out is so cheap and easy in Taipei)? I myself don't intend to cook at all
3. How do you maintain cleanliness?
4. If an issue arises between tenants, how is that addressed/resolved?
5. How do you hang your laundry to dry? I've heard that most Taiwanese homes do not have drying machines.

Does the landlord usually help at all with these or no?

Yes, there is Borderless housing, who offer clear expectations and support but they seem to only provide the bare minimum for furniture/decor and be more expensive compared to most other private listings of equal or better caliber I've seen on FB.

in Taipei, it becomes a norm to see abandoned dogs nearby hiking areas or mountain areas. for this reason, i started to bring dog (and cat) food whenever i go.

so i went to Erziping Visitor Center to report about her. show the staff the the picture and her location.  i was told they know about her and confirmed she‚Äôs abandoned. they already call some animal rescue to get her.

762,Overseas Study Tour,"&gt; ‚ÄúWhen the Study Tour Program officially ended in 2013 after an incredible 46-year run, the important link and deep connections that had been forged between OCAC and the global alumni community was invariably lost,"" said Christine Hsu, founder of the Love Boat Alumni Initiative.

‚Ä¶

&gt; What had started out as a ""soft power"" effort by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC) in Taiwan ‚Äì now called the Overseas Community Affairs Council ‚Äì had unintentionally morphed into one of the most positive, life-defining experiences for the more than 10,000 now baby boomers and Generation X'ers who attended the program. Many went on to found prominent companies and organizations on both sides of the Pacific. Some became leaders in business, government, and education, and still others are now high-profile personalities in film, media, and entertainment.

https://www.loveboatalumni.org/p/news.html?m=1

As an alumni (who didn‚Äôt go to this reunion) crippling this program in the early 2000‚Äôs seems pretty short sighted.

I sent my kids to China instead and while they don‚Äôt favor the PRC it‚Äôs only because I went on the Love Boat and my influence has been pro-Taiwan but for sure C-Drama and their China trip was far more culturally influential for them than anything from Taiwan‚Ä¶

Likely for many 2nd/3rd gen Chinese-Americans the Taiwan issue is not really on their radar.

How much political power/influence held by American born Chinese-Americans is debatable‚Ä¶but without soft power influence from Taiwan there will be less and less counterpoint to the legions of immigrants from the PRC who often think Taiwan belongs to China and we (the US) should stop supporting Taiwan.

783,Experiences studying Mandarin at NCCU,"Hi all, so I have been accepted to NCCU's CLC for the upcoming winter semester but there is very limited information about the program online. Especially when compared to NTNU's MTC, which is perhaps the most popular program. I applied last Sunday, and am still waiting for MTC to respond to my application. My preferred choice would be MTC, but it's located in the city center and I am worried that I may not be able to secure housing, especially within my budget of 10,000 to 15,000 NTD. And considering that I will only be in Taipei for 3 months it might be difficult to find a rental for that short of a period of time.

Meanwhile, if I go to NCCU, I have an opportunity to do a ""homestay"" with a retired professor named ""Merry"" (I am assuming that she is a former NCCU professor..and is female). By ""homestay"", it's basically a room, shared spaces, and apparently a simple breakfast Mon-Fri for 15,000 NTD a month. I contacted her and she said that I am welcome to stay with her when I come to Taipei if I choose to go to NCCU. But would recommend that I find a place closer to MTC if I choose to go there.

I just want to know if anyone has any experience studying at NCCU as a Mandarin language student. I know that it is a rather small program, especially when compared to MTC. Is there a great/sufficient diversity in the student body and classes offered? How easy is it to meet new people, make friends, get study buddies to hang out in the city with at NCCU CLC?

What is the placement test like?

Also, one other thing that is concerning is that after sending me my admission package, email communication with NCCU has been excruciatingly slow, or basically nonexistent lol. I was trying to ask them how to apply for my visa through their email at: [mandarin@nccu.edu.tw](mailto:mandarin@nccu.edu.tw)

Finally, when you register for classes at NCCU, do you get to pick which time slot you want to take the class at your appropriate level, or is that assigned to you? I know that it said that they offer classes typically at two time slots: 8:10-11:00 and 12:10-15:00. I don't know if I can get up for the 8 am session lol. Though neither time slot is necessarily ideal hah.

**TLDR**: What are the classes at NCCU like? Can you choose your class time? Is it easy to make friends/study buddies? Is heading into the city convenient? Can you switch classes if you don't like your teacher? How intense is the program?",https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1fvn0f2/experiences_studying_mandarin_at_nccu/,self.taiwan,2024-10-04 01:48:57,Melon3Yangmay,2024-10-04

817,For those worried about flights during typhoon,"A little travel report from a slightly anxious flyer. Hope this helps calm some nerves!

Just landed home in Sydney. We flew out of Taoyuan last night 2nd Oct, 11:15pm.

We got to the airport early because of hotel checkout (11am) and I really thought we were going to sit around for hours only to get cancelled last minute. Looking out the terminal windows, with only an hour or so until our flight, rain was heavy and almost horizontal. Wind rattling windows. We were puzzled why our flight (and many other flights) were still going ahead while others cancelled. Sure the typhoon was still south of Taiwan but the visible conditions seemed poor.

With Taoyuan winds reported as 40-50km/hr with 60-70km gusts, i thought if we do fly, it‚Äôll be a rollercoaster. 

Eventually we boarded, the cancellation never came.

Flight was surprisingly steady. Just a little turbulence but nothing out of ordinary. In fact we‚Äôve had much worse flights in visibility better conditions.

Don‚Äôt quote me on this but our A350 airbus can take up to 40kts, so about 70km - and these are crosswind limits. Thankfully the wind direction was in our favor, creating a nice headwind for Taoyuan‚Äôs runway.

Having said that takeoff is safer, I imagine landing in those conditions might be rough.

TLDR

Strong winds aren‚Äôt necessarily bad, it just depends on direction.

Don‚Äôt get freaked out by a bit of weather.

If you‚Äôre wondering if your flight will be cancelled, most likely no, so pack your bags and get ready!

827,I got married in Taiwan. Now thinking about the ARC,"Hi Reddit,

I'm based in the US but traveled to Taiwan recently to marry my wife there bc she's Taiwanese. We've been talking about me possibly moving to Taiwan so the topic of alien resident certificate (ARC) came up. I have all the required documents ready to go. The thing is, I'm not sure when I'll be fully ready to move there but I would like to at least have the ARC just in case when the time comes.

With that said, is it possible to go to Taiwan to apply and get the ARC, fly back to the US, and move to Taiwan later on (maybe 6mo, 1yr, or more) when the time is right? Does anyone know typically how long it takes to apply in Taiwan and receive the ARC? Any help or websites where I can find more info would be really helpful!",https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1fumbfl/i_got_married_in_taiwan_now_thinking_about_the_arc/,self.taiwan,2024-10-02 18:46:03,rand113,2024-10-02

I hope this isn't a super common post to get on here, I did a cursory glance and didn't see much about this, but please feel free to link me some posts if I missed them if I just looked a little harder lol

I am planning on studying abroad at NTU this upcoming spring semester, and it'll be the first time I'm going to live and learn in a place I haven't grown up in all my life, so I'm a little nervous about being the obnoxious foreigner that doesn't know anything. I've done a lot of general research and watched a lot of videos about Taiwan and some of the culture, but something I haven't really seen much of is what the college atmosphere is like? Specifically at NTU would be helpful.

If anyone could give some insight to daily life on a college campus, things to do/not do, what's the expected engagement and teaching styles I may encounter, etc. Anything would be helpful, whether own experiences or videos or posts around the internet that are accurate to the experience.

Additionally, part of my application is providing a Chinese name to put on my student ID, and I'm unsure what the feeling is around foreigners having non-transliterated names is in Taiwan, especially among college age students. I was given two names by two different people, and if people could give me some advice on which to use on the application and government documents, I would very much appreciate it!

859,Chailease pending credit card transaction disappeared,"So I have booked a rental car via Chailease on 20 September. Paid via ApplePay on their website.

It remained in status pending until 26 September, then it suddenly disappeared without actually being charged from my credit card &amp; has not been charged until today.

I'm now wondering whether this is expected behavior? Will the transaction only be charged once the rental period begins? Or do payments in Taiwan just take a bit longer to process (I'm located in the EU)?

I have already reached out to Chailease, they have confirmed that they see the reservation as complete &amp; paid. Also tried contacting my bank, however they did not respond (yet). 

Just a bit worried that once I arrive in Taipei, Chailease might want me to pay again or something like that.

867,I am looking a Drama from Taiwan,"Hello, everyone

I‚Äôm looking for an old Taiwanese drama that I watched a while ago. It was quite long, around 40 to 50 episodes. The story is about a young couple who get married right after high school. The girl was a vegetarian, and the boy later goes to military service. When he returns, he starts selling houses. In the first episode, the boy proposes to the girl while they are still in high school, but he loses the engagement ring. Initially, the girl doesn‚Äôt want to get married, but she eventually agrees. The boy‚Äôs father works all the time, and his mother has cancer and eventually passes away. There were no modern cell phones in the drama, so it seems quite old.

I do not remember the name, but it was in youtube.

While preparing the trip, I am now facing an issue that I hope you can help me out with.

I will be flying to Taipei with China Airlines. I booked a ticket for me and a friend, but she might not join after all, unfortunately. The ticket mentions a 'no show fee', but the wording on this fee is so vague that I cannot determine when this is applicable. Cancelling just her ticket alone seems to be a problem, as China Airlines apparently only allows you to cancel the entire booking (i.e. both tickets). Does this mean if it's just me showing up for the flight, we will have to pay the no show fee? Or is this fee only applicable if, for example, we change our flights in the very last minute?

However, this kind of Taiwan nationalism may have a big weak point:ÈáëÈñÄ and È¶¨Á•ñ.

Known famously, these islands have historically been parts of Á¶èÂª∫ÁúÅ, and their tie with Taiwan was formed rather by the accidental fact that the KMT managed to keep its administration over those islands while they had to move into Taiwan.

Thus, these islands had had a flow of history different from Taiwan until the KMT's escape, so it may be the case that those in these territories cannot share with those in Formossa a common story of national unification derived from multiple colonial rules and ethnic origins of the island.

I wonder how you, Taiwanese people, will fix and resolve this contradiction.",https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1fs68o7/taiwan_nationalism_and_ÈáëÈ¶¨Âú∞Âå∫_could_they_be/,self.taiwan,2024-09-29 15:56:59,gorudo-,2024-09-29
896,NYE in Taipei,"Hi dear friends!

I've been to Taiwan late 2015 early 2016 for my exchange semester. I'm about to buy tickets to come for NYE this year. Would you advise me to do so?

I'd come for 10 days (i know this is in no world enough, but at least it would give me the opportunity to visit this great island again). I would spend a few days in Taipei, visit Taroko Gorges, and maybe alishan or Tainan/Kaohsiung during this time.

Is the NYE firework still planned this year? Is the season good enough to visit (not too much rain...)?

Thank you for your advice!",https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1fs5t0k/nye_in_taipei/,self.taiwan,2024-09-29 15:37:37,01110100-01110111,2024-09-29
