0,Fast Bespoke Tailor ,"Hello everyone,

some friends and I are visiting Hong Kong for 5 days mid November.

I heard many people say that tailored suits in Hong Kong are unbeaten for price quality ratio.

As a german student a tailored suit is normaly out of my price range, but in HK it seems you get way more value.

Is it even possible to get a get a suit done in under 48h to maybe wear it to a nice birthday dinner? If yes what is the budget for a lower end suit I should plan with ? 

Can you recommend any places? Thank you in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1gjf4og/fast_bespoke_tailor/,self.HongKong,2024-11-04 14:10:39,Innocent-Dimir-Boie,2024-11-04

&gt;A company’s designated representative must be either a shareholder, director or an employee of the company who is a natural person resident in Hong Kong or, alternatively, an accounting professional, a legal professional or a person licensed to carry on a business as trust or company service provider.

Everywhere I look for this specific service (different company registration websites designed for foreigners), the provider is charging HK$1000-1500 per year just to put their name on the paper. While it is not a crazy amount of money, as a small business owner who is just starting, the costs keep piling up and I wonder if there is a more cost-effective solution - especially, since this is so passive just to tick the box.

19,HKID renewal question - Can you ask for two copies of the acknowledgement of application?,"Hi!

I have a bit of a complicated situation. I will be heading to HK in a few months to renew my (non-PR, I have RTL status) HKID card. Long story short, I will need to have someone pick up my card as I won't be in HK when pickup is ready and I know there's a limited time that the card can be picked up.

Here's the situation, my understanding is that when you exit HK while the card is in process, you need a travel document (foreign passport in my case) and the acknowledgement of application paper to show at immigration. The problem is that the person who is picking up my ID card is required to have said acknowledgement of application paper. Is there a way for me to get two copies of the acknowledgement of applicaton? One for me to exit HK and one for the person picking up my HKID card?

  
Alternatively, can I enter HK with my passport, submit the HKID card renewal, then leave HK with just my passport?

21,What kind of people enjoy living in Hong Kong? ,"I think this topic can definitely be quite polarizing, and this subreddit is definitely an example. Plenty of people who absolutely hate HK, but also many who love it, especially after they leave. I've been watching a lot of videos about living in HK, whether from the POV of locals still in HK or locals who have left and moved elsewhere (usually UK/Canada/Aus). And also content from foreigners who moved to HK, including foreign-born Asians. 

Here are some obvious ones I can think of:

* Have money or make lots of it 
* Being Chinese or white - obviously Chinese as the ethnic majority, and white because of systemic racial privilege
* Love dining out/shopping/travelling 
* Enjoy a ""fast-paced"", convenient or materialistic lifestyle 

But I'd go further to add (but these are more up for disagreement): 

* Introverts - there's not much small talk and you can easily keep to yourself 
* People who don't really want to integrate or meet people from different backgrounds - For expats, it's easy to get by without integrating or learning Cantonese especially if you move to certain locations like DB or mid-levels. 
* Foreigners who want to integrate - on the flip side, I also think HK being a big city with a large and dense population means that it's also easy to meet friends and integrate if you want to. There's a lot of interest groups and social activities going on. Plus, HK being not a family-friendly city means you'll meet more people in the 20s and 30s who want to meet new people and socialize, as opposed to settling down and having children. 
* Conformists - HK can be a pretty judgemental society. It's not great for artists, or people living non-mainstream lifestyles. But if you're a ""typical model of success"" by HK standards (heterosexual, university educated, high income, in the rat race, believes in the face concept), then HK can feel very safe to you. 
* Politically apathetic - self explanatory. Bonus if they only care about safety and social harmony above all else.

Hi everyone!

I am looking to get some help planning my trip to Macau as an NZ Citizen. I have a layover arriving in Hong Kong International Airport 4:20 PM Jan 31 2025 and then leaving to my next destination Feb 1 4:15 PM.

In my head I plan to go through Hong Kong immigration, drop off my suitcase at a bag storage in the airport and travel around with a back pack. 

Make my way to Macau and check in at one of the cheaper hotels in the Ponte 16 area. Look at the attractions there and grab a meal (looking for suggestions)

Visit the Cotai Strip and have a play around in the casinos and touring the area. 

Leave the next morning to Hong Kong, eat at Kam’s Roast Goose and then do shopping of some kind if time allows (suggestions please) and then try to be back at the airport around 2PM.

My questions are:

If this plan sounds feasible or if there is a better way to do this?

When and where would I go through immigration, is it at the ports and will I need to do this before I can go on the HZMB busses (what is the process)?

The time I visit will be Chinese New Year apparently, so do I need to account for shops being closed and will there be different schedules for transport and stores?

And currency wise, should I carry HKD, Patacas, both and how much would be a reasonable budget?

Just any other tips, suggestions or advice you have as well :)

Thanks to all those that can help me, really appreciate it!!

38,From Lost Youth to Verdict: Five Years in Limbo for Hong Kong Twin Brothers,"# From Lost Youth to Verdict: Five Years in Limbo for Hong Kong Twin Brothers

On July 1, 2019, as Hong Kong marked its 22nd anniversary of the handover to China, the city witnessed one of its most tumultuous days. Among the thousands who gathered near the government headquarters in Admiralty were two 14-year-old twin brothers, **Dai Ka-ping (戴嘉平) and Dai Ka-ching (戴嘉正)**.

The twins were among four defendants recently sentenced by Deputy District Judge David Cheung (暫委區域法院法官張志偉) for their involvement in the protests. While two co-defendants received three-year prison terms, the twins were sentenced to a training centre for a minimum of six months, with the judge considering their youth at the time of the offense.

[Days before the verdict, Ka-ping voluntarily shaved his head, preparing himself for the trial's outcome. \(Photo source: HK City Creation.\)](https://preview.redd.it/mxq2x7kzenyd1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54fd3bd72646c11dca3ff0d3eafbad609be19e8c)

The Moment That Changed Everything

The events of July 1, 2019 are etched in their memory. **""I was looking back for him, and he was looking back for me,""** Ka-ping recalls. **""When we finally found each other, police charged forward. Some protesters pushed me down, which caused him to fall too. The fall was sudden - when I opened my eyes, I saw everyone running. As I tried to get up, I saw someone in blue uniform and helmet charging towards us, swinging a baton.""**

The guilt weighs heavily on Ka-ping's conscience. **""My biggest regret is that my brother was behind me. If I hadn't fallen, he wouldn't have fallen either,""** he says, blaming himself for his brother's arrest.

But Ka-ching sees it differently. ""If I had walked away, I would have regretted it deeply. He fell right in front of me, and within a second or two, I fell too. **Yes, I might have had a chance to escape if I hadn't helped him, but if I had chosen to abandon him, I would have regretted it forever.** In that moment, there wasn't even time to think.""

During the interview, the twins offered raw, unfiltered descriptions of each other that cut to the core of their relationship. **The younger Ka-ping characterizes his brother as ""simple-minded but principled, stubborn, and socially awkward"" (""戇居、有原則、硬頸、社交能力差""). Ka-ching, in turn, describes his younger brother as ""brave, undisciplined, impulsive, and all talk"" (""勇敢、無交帶、衝動、死剩把口"").** These candid assessments, heard by each brother for the first time, speak to the unvarnished honesty of their relationship.

[An intimate moment between the Dai twins. \(Photo source: HK City Creation\)](https://preview.redd.it/s39kajuefnyd1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38f5bb0e36e334bb503574f0c1da27b5bd37fe7d)

Five Years in Limbo: A Lost Youth

**""Initially, I just wanted to do well in DSE, complete my student union term, make it to my birthday, to my girlfriend's birthday... who would have thought the final judgment date would fall on my father's birthday. Life plays cruel jokes,""** Ka-ping reflects. Beyond these personal milestones, he once dreamed of becoming the youngest Legislative Council member in history - a childhood aspiration now suspended in time.

**""What has this case done to me? It has destroyed everything - making any future planning impossible,""** Ka-ping says, clutching his head in visible distress.

**""I'm afraid Hong Kong will become a place I can no longer accept... Maybe when I come out, there will be things I won't be able to speak about anymore. I don't know how long I'll have to wait before I can speak freely again,""** Ka-ping shares, his concerns focused not on his own fate but on his city's future.

Despite these fears, he maintains his resolve to stay: **""I believe destiny can be changed. Maybe this time we'll have to wait longer, but we can still try to do limited things within limited space, trying our best to protect this place. Even if we have to leave, don't forget this place.""**

# Final Moments of Freedom

On the day of the verdict, Ka-ping arrived at court more than an hour early, taking photos with family, friends, and university colleagues. When the guilty verdict was announced, he nodded slightly, then turned to the public gallery, forcing himself to smile while holding both sides of his mouth. During the 15-minute recess that followed, when his family and friends were not present, witnesses say he wept, repeatedly wiping his eyes before returning to face the court.

**""Our political enlightenment came from our father,""** Ka-ping reveals. **""Since we were young, we would hear him talk about 'Long Hair' Leung Kwok-hung and Wong Yuk-man.""**

# ""I'm not sorry to society,"" Ka-ping states with conviction. ""I'm sorry to my family. They shouldn't have to suffer like this."" His brother adds with characteristic stoicism, ""I'm just going to live somewhere else for a while. We need to face what's coming with calmness and courage.""

In his mitigation letter to the judge, Ka-ping wrote that his concern for politics and participation in protests, even the actions that led to this case, all stemmed from his love for Hong Kong. **""Don't give yourself too much to think about, keep yourself busy,""** was the advice given by his mentor, former Democratic Party chairwoman Emily Lau (劉慧卿). He thanked not only his loved ones but also himself for managing to live well in the present moment.

While Ka-ping expressed remorse to his family, across social media platforms and comment sections, many Hong Kongers suggested that it was society that had failed its young people. The twins' story - from their arrest at 14 to their sentencing at 20 - has become, for many, a symbol of a generation's lost youth.

Context: The Training Centre System

While the judge's decision to send the twins to a training centre rather than prison was presented as a more lenient option considering their youth, Hong Kong's training centre system has faced scrutiny. The centres, which accept offenders between 14 and 20 years old, emphasize discipline and vocational training, with detention periods capped at three years.

According to accounts from former inmates and staff featured in the 2017 Hong Kong film ""With Prisoners"" (同囚), conditions in these facilities can be particularly challenging for young offenders. The centres operate under a strict disciplinary regime that some critics argue may be more demanding than adult prisons.

The exact duration of detention is determined by the correctional services chief, and those released may be subject to three years of supervision, including mandatory curfews and reporting requirements.

46,Hong Kong Cinema's Self-Censorship Era: Veteran Director Johnnie To Breaks Silence in Landmark Interview,"**Hong Kong Cinema's Self-Censorship Era: Veteran Director Johnnie To Breaks Silence in Landmark Interview**

[Source: BBC \(https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SvqZc7S9D24\)](https://preview.redd.it/5p7gb27j0iyd1.png?width=1910&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff8666d020f60eb86a7738900eea29cac14a7052)

In a powerful and revealing interview with BBC News Cantonese, Johnnie To (杜琪峯), one of Hong Kong's most celebrated filmmakers and a director who has earned international acclaim including recognition at Cannes, Venice, and Berlin film festivals, has offered an unprecedented glimpse into Hong Kong's changing cultural landscape and the realities of filmmaking under increasing constraints.

The veteran filmmaker, whose illustrious career spans over four decades and includes critical successes like ""Election,"" ""Breaking News,"" and ""Drug War,"" finds himself at what he describes as **""the lowest point in my life""** (""最近都是我人生最低潮的時候""). Having built a reputation for exploring themes of friendship, fate, and Hong Kong's evolving society, Johnnie To now faces profound creative challenges.

He spoke candidly about the loss of artistic freedom: **""I feel there's no soul now, including both myself and Hong Kong""** (""我覺得現在沒有靈魂，包括我和香港都沒有了""). This crisis, he emphasized, stems from the erosion of **""human rights and freedom""** (""人權和自由"").

When asked about topics filmmakers must avoid, Johnnie To responded with characteristic sharp insight: **""You know what? It's strange that you're asking me this,""** (""你知道的，你問我很奇怪"") he remarked, before laying bare the reality of self-censorship: **""Why needlessly create confrontation? If you don't want to touch that red line, if you don't want to raise suspicions... then don't say too much about Hong Kong affairs""** (""無謂直接去衝撞，你不想碰到那條紅線，或者你不想有些被懷疑的話，你就不要說那麼多，關於香港的事"").

His advice was particularly telling: **""Don't talk too much regarding Hong Kong's current political situation - just make more romance films, family dramas instead""** (""你就不要說太多，關於香港現在政治上的事，你就多說些愛情，說些親情""). 

Johnnie To offered pointed criticism of current governance approaches: **""A government with confidence wouldn't do this. They have no confidence in the people, no confidence in society""** (""有信心的政府會這樣嗎？對人沒有信心，對人民沒有信心，對社會沒有信心""). He dismissed official displays of prosperity as superficial, stating **""Setting off fireworks pretending Hong Kong is prosperous - who are you trying to fool? Even grandma won't be fooled""** (""放下煙花當香港很繁榮，你騙誰啊，婆婆都騙不了"").

Johnnie To reflected on Hong Kong's transition: **""In the 80s we talked about it, in the 90s we knew return to China was inevitable. What determined our future way of life? The Basic Law. I believed in the Basic Law,""** after a pause, he added with notable emphasis, **""I still believe in the original one""** (""我覺得，我相信基本法，現在還相信，原來那個""). 

Despite opportunities to work overseas, the renowned director maintains an unwavering commitment to Hong Kong cinema: **""I stick to filming in Hong Kong - how can I go elsewhere when I can't even fully grasp my own culture?""** (""我連香港自己成長的地方的文化，我都捉得不夠準，我怎會去別的地方學別人的東西""). This dedication comes at a personal cost, as he reveals: **""I keep writing and throwing away scripts - I don't even know how many I've discarded""** (""變成想完一次又扔掉，想完一次又扔掉，都不知道扔了多少東西"").

The founder of independent production house Milkyway Image (銀河映像) in 1996 described his current creative paralysis: **""I used to be very confident about my film concepts, but in recent years I've had many doubts""** (""我以前對構思上，對電影的信心很強，這幾年會覺得有很多懷疑""). He distinguished his current struggles from past challenges, noting **""My crisis isn't about money - I haven't lost my ideals due to poverty before, but now I've lost them""** (""以前沒有錢，不是代表沒有了我的理想，現在是沒有了"").

Johnnie To, who has served on juries at all three major international film festivals - Cannes, Venice, and Berlin, used a striking metaphor to describe the industry's current state: **""How can you fight against an elephant's foot when you're just an ant? If it steps on you, you're dead""** (""你怎樣能夠頂得住一隻大象的腳，你只有一隻矮的時候，踩中必死"").

The interview comes at a critical juncture for Hong Kong cinema, as the industry grapples with new film censorship regulations and changing political dynamics. As a filmmaker known for his ability to work across genres and his distinctive style mixing realism with highly stylized elements, Johnnie To's current creative paralysis speaks to broader issues facing Hong Kong's cultural sector. **""In terms of industry and art, this is not a good era""** (""在工業上也好，藝術上也好，各方面都不是一個好的時代""), he observed.

While the struggles he describes are well-known within Hong Kong's film industry, Johnnie To's willingness to speak openly about these challenges makes him one of the most prominent figures to publicly address the creative constraints facing Hong Kong filmmakers today. His candid revelations carry particular weight given his stature in both local and international cinema.

47,Why Indian grocery stores don't price tag their products?,"After a visit to a popular Indian Restaurant in Chungking Mansion, I decided to visit the  grocery stores on the ground floor to look for spices to up my curry cooking game. While we were looking around in 3 different stores we found that none of them put price tags on their products. At first we thought it might be because they were smaller so they didn't bother to do so. But the one we ended up buying from was large (also probably do wholesale business) and has a proper cash register with barcode scanner.

I bought several small bags like cumin powder after having confirmed the prices first with the cashier. Each of them costed around $12, which I thought was reasonable. But I still couldn't help but wondered if they might have two prices - one for regular Indian customers, one for non-Indian ""strays"" like me. Am I wrong to suspect that?

Having said that I would still be going back to shop there. This one has so many different spices and I want to try all of them.

I know ShenZhen where many local people they were immigrants from mainland China and less locals may speak Cantonese but understand some.

I’m looking for some advice on where to buy a dual SIM iPhone in Hong Kong at a reasonable price. Here’s my situation:

I live in Europe, but I regularly visit Hong Kong and China since my in-laws are there. The online eSIM plans for China and Hong Kong are quite pricey compared to local plans, so I’ve opted for a local Chinese SIM and sometimes buy minutes/data for Hong Kong when needed.

I’d like to simplify things by getting an iPhone with dual SIM capabilities. Since I also need eSIM functionality for Europe, a Chinese iPhone isn’t an option. I’ve checked out some shops in Hong Kong, like the local Apple store, Broadway, and a few others. However, I’m open to other reliable options where locals get iPhones at decent prices, even second-hand stores, as long as I can verify authenticity.

Any recommendations on where I can find a good deal on an iPhone in Hong Kong? I’m not too concerned about warranty since I live in Europe anyway.

I read on the Labour Department website that what they are doing for statutory holidays is illegal but I’m not too sure about the sick leave policy. 

I work in a industry where it’s very easy for me to get sick so it feels unfair that I still have to lose so much money, getting sick from a work environment that’s very prone to sickness.

	•	Layover: 2 hours and 20 minutes in Hong Kong
	•	Second flight: Hong Kong to India on Indigo Airlines

Here are the details and questions:

	•	Arrival in Hong Kong: 11:50 AM
	•	Check-in/Bag Drop for Indigo flight closes: 1:10 PM

This gives me 1 hour and 20 minutes to go through immigration, pick up my baggage, check in with Indigo, and pass security.

Questions:

	1.	Is it realistically possible to complete all these steps in 1 hour and 20 minutes?
	2.	If it’s too tight, would traveling with only carry-on luggage allow me to skip immigration and go directly to the Indigo check-in desk? Would 1 hour and 20 minutes be sufficient in this case?
	3.	According to the Hong Kong Immigration website, Indian citizens in transit don’t need a visa, only the Pre-Arrival Registration (PAR). If I need to clear immigration to recheck my baggage, will the PAR suffice, or would I need a visa since I’d technically be leaving the transit area?

Thank you all for any guidance!

I've been here exactly one year ago, loved the city and me and my colleague have been wandeling around, walked over 30k on this one day. Last year we have been to the peak, the zoo parc close, went with the ferry, into Mong kok etc. We've done quite a bit..

These are all the highlights I believe, so my question is, what should we do this year, we can go that round again but feels a bit like a waste. We can also go to a spa for a day but that's also a bit of a waste imho.
What did we miss? We have one night, morning and full afternoon till 20.00 again.

Also, need some advice for tonight dinner, price is not an issue, needs to be good but not to classy. And, Sorry to say, not Chinese, kantonese etc. We've been having enough of this in the past few days.. maybe some Korean, Japanese or just a good piece of Meat:) 

Look forward to some advice!

We are a family of 3 plus one dog. My husband will be working remotely while we are there but we also have a 12 month old son at the time of move.

I'm from the US and so we're used to having daycares a plenty to drop off and watch your kids all day. However, it looks as though that is virtually not a thing here in Hong Kong. In terms of a domestic helper, would they be willing to work for only 6 months or so? How much should I expect for their salary (i.e. so I can ask my company for reimbursement) Do most families do both domestic helper and play groups or do kids mainly stay at home?

Lastly - my understanding is most leases in Hong Kong are 2 years unless they're serviced apartments. Since domestic helpers will need room and board, most of those serviced apartments do not have places for them (is that right?).

137,URGENT: Bethune House needs your help,"Bethune House faces closure this year if donations do not come in ASAP. For those who don't know, Bethune House is a charity which supports domestic helpers facing abuse. With Hong Kong's law that DHs must find a new employer within 14 days of contract termination - many helpers are reluctant to leave abusive households. However, Bethune House facilitates shelter and support for those in those positions, providing help for those victims. The mistreatment of domestic workers in Hong Kong is sadly commonplace, therefore, Bethune House has received many more helpers at its doors. But with funds being especially slow this year, it is at risk of closure. I cannot stress how crucial this organisation is to DHs. Helpers already have very little resources when abuse occurs, so the closure of Bethune House would be detrimental to the entire community of DHs. Bethune House needs funds urgently as this is a last call for donations. Please donate or spread the word. Watch this YouTube video which gives insight on the charity and some anecdotes as well!

I am asking this question because I heard investing in HK and Chinese stocks is not that good.

I currently invest with Questrade. For those unfamiliar with it, to deposit money into a Questrade account, you can add your account to your bank, and make bill payments. So in my case, I make bill payments from my Canadian bank account. This will be in CAD, and then I would use something called Norbert’s Gambit to convert from CAD to USD, and then buy USD stocks.

What would be the best way to invest HKD from a Hong Kong bank account in US stocks? I would prefer to continue using my Questrade account, as I would not want to deal with multiple brokers. And of course, I would want to lose as less money as possible to fees such as currency conversion.

Chiang Mai-Hong Kong (Arriving at 0930am)

I am not sure how it works with picking up a checked bag on a separate ticket as I have never had this situation before so I appreciate any/all advice. 

Also—I can change my 0930 arrival flight to a flight that arrives at 1130pm the prior night but would rather not have an awkwardly long layover before a long international flight.

177,Biggest cultural differences between Hong Kong and USA? ,"Hi everyone! I (20F) am a white American, and my boyfriend (24M) was born and raised in Hong Kong. He has been in the USA for a year for college and that’s how we met. I, on the other hand, have never been outside the USA! We have been dating for 1.5 years, have an amazing dynamic together and are pursuing a long term future. 

My family likes him in general, but they have continuously expressed that they are worried our different backgrounds will lead to an unhappy future (they have never been outside of the US). However, he and I have the same religious values, same morals/standards, same life goals (number of children, place we want to live, timeline of when it’s happening, etc), and our personalities are very compatible. If it helps, he has told me that his parents raised him in a more laid-back way by letting him choose what hobbies and career he wanted, and not pushing/pressuring him towards any specific direction. He converted to Christianity before he met me, and they do not mind at all.

When it comes to raising children - and in general - what would you say are the biggest cultural differences between Hong Kong and the USA? Anything that could possibly be an irreconcilable difference? When I ask him, he says he doesn’t know.

199,Question on Right of Abode/Right to Land Application,"Hi! I’ve been looking at HK’s Right of Abode for the last couple of weeks since I will be traveling back to HK with my mom in late Nov. and was thinking of applying. 

For background, both my parents were born in HK in 1956. My mom left in 1969 and became an American citizen in 1981. I was born in the US in 1995 and do not have any other citizenships other than the US. Based on what I have read, my mom would be eligible for an HK ID and Right of Abode bc she was originally born in HK. She did not have an HKID when she left. I would also be eligible for right of abode/right to land based on descent, I believe. 

Based on that info, I have a couple of questions: 

1. Since my mother was originally born in HK, she would only have to complete the Application for Verification of Eligibility for Permanent Identity Card, correct? 

2. Since I believe that I am eligible under Schedule 2(c), I would have to submit the Application for Certificate of Entitlement to Right of Abode, correct? Once I submit that (and assuming it is approved), would I also have to submit an application for Verification of Eligibility for Permanent Identity Card or is the former enough? 

3. I am also assuming that, because my mom doesn’t currently have a HKID, she would need to complete her application first, get her HKID, and then I would be able to do mine? 

4. What’s the typical processing time for these applications? I will be in HK for two weeks but my mom will only be there for a week so just want to make sure we have enough time to at least get hers done.

We were mindful not to disturb anyone at the temple, stepping out of the way when necessary, and my poses were respectful and modest.

213,How do you store your winter/summer clothes/ appliances/ blankets etc.,"As a family of 5, we have a ton of summer and winter clothes, a few heaters for each room, and thick blankets (my mum and grandma gets cold quickly). Now that the winter season is coming up, we are slowly bringing them out but I want to store our summer clothes better as we do that because it looks like an eyesore with the storage boxes laying around each room.

We have changed our beds to have storage underneath (We have 3. One of them being almost half the size of me lol), have tried vacuum-sealing them, and even gave away a lot of our items just so it can fit in the house but it has been difficult. Are we missing something on better storage? 

I have suggested getting better looking boxes so that it doesn’t look as bad but maybe there are better ways to store these things that we are not familiar with. Any tips or suggestions? 

Context: We don’t have a storage room or a balcony or rooftop (just a regular apartment with 3 bedrooms and 1 toilet) but we do have weird ledges/ countertops (idk what to call them) by the window. I wanted it to be a table or even a reading nook or just an open space but with all the boxes, it is impossible because the boxes just cover 2/3 of the window.

214,Moving to Hong Kong as a doctor: yes or no?,"Hi, I'm based in the UK and came across the Hong Kong Hospital Authority's recruitment campaign for doctors from overseas. For context, I'm early in my career (not a specialist) and not from a Chinese background. Most of my family are here in the UK.

Compared to the UK, salary is 2-2.5x higher with a fraction of the tax. To be admitted to a specialist training programme (residency) in the UK is also becoming insanely competitive, often requiring years of stagnation in non-training jobs to be successful - this does not seem to be the case in HK. Medicine seems a more secure and valued career in HK than the UK, but I have heard the system demands a lot of its employees. I suppose I might also be less internationally mobile later on if I decided to leave HK than if I did all my training in the UK.

I visited HK in the semi-recent past and thought it was amazing, though I have read people's concerns on this sub. I feel a bit stuck, with potentially limited career prospects and the broader sense of decline here at home. I'm fairly confident that I'd like to leave the UK. Is HK the place to try?

We are native English speakers, but speak cantonese at home (parents grew up in HK and near GZ respectively), our mandarin is also passable. We have extended family in HK/GD so that is a perk as well.

235,Apartment rental &amp; landlord breaking the contract,"Hey everyone! I'm in a bit of a pickle with my ex-landlord and could really use some advice. Here's the story in a nutshell:

Last August 2023, I signed a lease with my now ex-landlord starting from September 1, 2023. The lease was your typical setup: one year fixed with a one-year option (with a two-month notice period). The contract stated that either party could terminate early by giving a two-month written notice or paying two months' rent in lieu, but not before the first year was up (*contract's real words: ""either party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement earlier than as herein provided by serving not less than 2 months’ written notice or by paying 2 months’ Rent in lieu to the other party provided that the said written notice shall not be served before the expiration of the 12 month of the Term of Tenancy.""*)

Beginning May 2024, my landlord dropped a bombshell, saying she needed the apartment back by August 1, 2024. I agreed to move out by then, but I asked for compensation for breaking the lease early. The landlord agreed to pay me one month's rent (landlord's real words: *""Unfortunately I will need the flat to be vacant before September 1st, which I have no flexibility and control.  Therefore I shall pay you months rent.""*)

Fast forward to August 2024, I vacated the apartment on 1st Aug as agreed upon with the landlord promising two months' rent as compensation.

Two months later (longer than what the contract states), I received my deposit back along with 1 month's compensation (why 1, I don't know). To make matters worse, the landlord sent me a bizarre bill for things that were already damaged (I can prove it) when I moved in and for unnecessary tasks like repainting pristine walls (that were in normal condition) and overpriced terrace cleaning (10k! It would take me not more than 1hr to do it).

The total on the bill adds up to around one month's rent, leaving me shortchanged by two months. I've tried to reason with the landlord but haven't heard back.

Now, I'm considering taking this to small claims court as I feel this situation is unfair. The compensation owed to me is significant (around 70k), which falls within the small claims tribunal's jurisdiction.

But I'm a bit lost here. Is it worth the hassle? Do you think I have a good chance of winning? Will the fees outweigh what I could potentially gain? If anyone has been through a similar ordeal or has any advice to offer, I'd really appreciate it!

There's 3 things I want to do.

1) See the view of the skyline from a rooftop bar. My plan is to go to Eyebar in TST. I just have some questions. Will I be able to get in on a Saturday night or will it be too busy? Do I need to book? Is there a dress code or will a tourist in t shirt and shorts be allowed in?

2) Go to the top of the Peak and see the view. I've heard the queue for the tram can be long. Is there a peak time? Will it be fine early in the morning when it first opens? Or should I just get a taxi?

3) Yum Cha. I think I have this one sorted. There's a place that opens at 6am so I figured I'd just go then when it's not too busy so I don't annoy any locals if I don't the understand customs/etiquette  and not overwhelmed by the chaos.

259,Rental,"
Hey everyone! 

I was in Hong Kong this week, looking at apartments to rent. I have mainly been viewing apartments in Quarry Bay, as that is where my office located. 

For 20k hkd, seems like i’ll only be able to get ~300sqft 1 bedroom apartments in this area. It’s really small, but the view is insane as it is on the 36th floor overseeing the harbour. 

If you were me, would you spend this amount for a really small apartment just so you could be 5mins walk from your office? 

Or would you use that 20k hkd to get a bigger apartment elsewhere? If yes, where?

271,My Exhausting Experience with @CathayPacific – A Travel Nightmare,"Hey everyone,  

I wanted to share my recent ordeal with **Cathay Pacific** to shed light on what happened and hopefully warn others. What started as a simple flight from Hong Kong to Singapore turned into an exhausting and frustrating experience.  

On **September 7th, 2024**, my family and I—six of us in total, including two elderly family members over 60 and two children aged 14 and 11—were booked on CX635. We had checked out of our hotel and were already on the way to the airport when I received an email. **Flight canceled**. With only six hours’ notice! No explanation, no proper communication—just a cancellation notice dropped into my inbox as we rushed to make the flight.  

After scrambling to get help, Cathay Pacific rebooked us on a later flight—CX715 at 9:00 PM. That meant we’d be stuck at the airport for 12 hours. We were all drained, but the worst came when my elderly mother fell unwell from the exhaustion just before boarding. She was too weak to fly, so we had to de-board and seek medical help at Raffles Clinic at HKIA.  

At that moment, all I wanted was for the airline to rebook us on the next available flight. But when I asked the staff for help, they refused, saying no rebooking or flight substitution was possible since it was a medical issue. I tried explaining our situation, but no one listened. With my mom unwell and no immediate solutions, I had no choice but to book a night at the Regal Airport Hotel at HKIA.  

Then, the next day—hours too late—I received an email at 12:40 PM on September 8th saying we had been rebooked on CR711 at 4:40 PM that day. By then, we had already bought tickets on Singapore Airlines (SQ893), costing us around $4000.  

This left me stunned.  

\- Why was I told rebooking wasn’t possible, only to get rebooked after the fact?  

\- Why wasn’t I notified sooner?

\- Who even authorized the rebooking without informing me?

This whole mess could have been avoided if Cathay Pacific had been clear from the start.  

After weeks of back-and-forth emails—yes, weeks—I finally received a call from their Hong Kong office. They said I could use the unused leg of the flight, but here’s the kicker: I had to pay the fare and tax difference, which came out to $1,000 for 4 tickets, my elderly parents refused to fly with Cathay Pacific again. 

Left with no other option, I agreed and paid the amount. But instead of a simple apology or acknowledgment, their staff tried to spin it as a service recovery—saying they were doing me a favor by waiving the rebooking and no-show fees. Honestly, these fees wouldn’t have even existed if Cathay Pacific hadn’t mismanaged everything in the first place!  

And as if that wasn’t enough, I politely requested an upgrade—just as a gesture of goodwill for the trouble we endured. They flat-out refused, without even pretending to care. The best they can offer is give out 5000miles to each of us, which I politely asked them to keep it to themself.

I’m not asking for compensation for the SQ893 flight, or the hotel stay; we had to make the call to fly with Singapore Airlines. But the least I expect from Cathay Pacific is to honor my original booking and let me rebook for 31st December 2024 without extra fees. 

Throughout this ordeal, I’ve spoken to six different representatives and received nothing but miscommunication, false information, and empty apologies. I’ve stayed patient, hoping for some resolution—but instead, I’ve been left drained and disappointed.  

If you’re traveling with Cathay Pacific, be aware: one canceled flight could derail everything, and you might end up paying even more to fix their mistakes. 

u/cathaypacific, please do the right thing. With Christmas around the corner, I hope you resolve this properly.

298,"Fixed Penalty Littering Fine, worth fighting?","In my locality residents deposit their trash in a black wheely bin that is periodically shuffled around by the waste workers. If the bin isn't there everyone leaves their trash next to the orange bin where the black bin is usually parked and the trash lady kindly comes to collect it. This should be considered a customary practice in legal terms. It has been this way for decades and as far as I know there has never been enforcement action.

Until today. Two plain clothes FEHD officers were perched ready to swoop and issue fines which were increased the day before to 3000HKD. They got me and another very unhappy uncle. They had erected new warning banners but these were entirely obscured by a delivery of building materials. Of the two officers one was profusely apologetic. They only stayed for half an hour and within two hours the usual pile of trash had accumulated.

The concept of a customary practice does exist in a legal sense and does influence enforcement of laws. Needless to say if they really wanted to help they could have issued a warning and told me to take the waste to a trash station. Issuing a fine that is a good chunk of my wage for engaging in a customary practice feels predatory and disproportionate, so I have half a mind to fight.

Most of the English information regarding this stuff is about speeding or parking fines. So I want to ask:

* Has anyone fought one of these fines? On what grounds, and did you win?
* Is there a downside to disputing the fine? I understand it will go before a magistrate. Are there any further costs or additional consequences?
* Is there any documentation of viable defenses?

337,Burglars Hit Former Police Chief: $100K Gone! ,"\[Yahoo News Report\] **The residence of Andy Tsang Wai-hung (曾偉雄), former Hong Kong Police Commissioner, was reportedly burglarized.** According to local media sources, **the break-in occurred at his Tai Po house between last night and this morning. Initial estimates indicating losses of at least HK$100,000.** The Regional Crime Unit of New Territories North is handling the investigation.

During his tenure as Police Commissioner (2011-2015), Tsang oversaw the ""Occupy Central"" movement. After retirement, he took up positions including Deputy Director of China's National Narcotics Control Commission.

This incident recalls a similar case from 1990, when Hong Kong's first Chinese Police Commissioner, Li Kwan-ha (李君夏 ), had his official residence burglarized.

News source: [https://hk.news.yahoo.com/據了解警務處前處長曾偉雄住所疑被爆竊-據報損失至少十萬元財物︱yahoo-142622600.html](https://hk.news.yahoo.com/據了解警務處前處長曾偉雄住所疑被爆竊-據報損失至少十萬元財物︱yahoo-142622600.html)

*Sidenote: Public Response &amp; Social Media*

The news has sparked widespread discussion on social media, with netizen sharing the infamous image of Tsang's emotional ""You have done nothing wrong!"" speech from October 2014. This image frequently resurfaces in comments sections of news reports involving police misconduct, serving as a pointed reminder of that historic moment. During the speech, Tsang became visibly emotional while defending police actions, though the delayed audience response and a pointed comment about tear gas deployment made the video go viral.

Back in the day in Hong Kong, if you got your phone via your carrier by signing up for a 3 year phone plan with them, you would save a reasonable amount of money on the phone. But the carriers would raise the price of the plans, to make up for the discount they gave you on the phone.

I have been using my phone for some 7 years now and it's time for me to buy the new IPhone 16. I went to SmartTone today, and if I sign a 2 year contract with them for 2 years for a 50 GB monthly plan (with 1 GB to use in Mainland China), for $179 per month (and an additional $18 admin fee, so it comes out to $197 per month), I only get a $1000 discount on the IPhone 16.

It seems the discount you get on phones these days from the carriers is pretty paltry, compared to the past. But at least you only need to sign with them for 2 years, instead of 3 years in the past.

So what are people in Hong Kong doing these days? Do you buy your phone separately at the phone store (ie. Apple store), and then also get a plan separately with the carrier after that?

These are taking excruciatingly long to get here. I’ve had to resort to getting more copies sent to a friend of mine and him DHL’ing them to me rather than just twiddling my thumbs waiting. When I have them, I’ll be going through an agency to help us apply. My question that I wanted to ask if anyone has experienced it. 

We have to leave HK mid November and I’m afraid that we won’t have the UK passport in time and so what would the consequences would there be (if any) were we to travel back to the UK and my daughter uses her HK passport whilst we await the UK passport?

Other than that, I’m completely free. My interests include hiking, running (are there any beautiful running paths in the city?), coffee, eating, shopping, and visiting speakeasy bars that would be great for a solo woman like me.

367,I arrived in Hong Kong and immediately flew away.,"I had to appoint my mother-in-law at Hong Kong Airport from Moscow and transfer to Danang Vietnam then. We used ""Hong Kong Express Airways Limited"" on the way to Danang. When I met her we had to find our terminal and the gate. I was incredibly shocked by how enormous the airport was. We got lost for a while because neither signs nor the information desk was on the route. I found a guy from HK Airways and asked him how we could reach the right destination for the flight, he took our passport and **responded that we had to pay an extra 240 HK dollars for the transfer**, as it was a low-cost airline. I was ready to pay but he called coworkers and said that we needed to make a stamp in the immigration center. We stayed for at least half an hour in a queue and finally got a stamp, left the airport, and immediately got back as we had to move out of Hong Kong. We spent a long time on these movements and finally found a check-in desk where HK Airways a young girl representative was asking about our visa in Vietnam, and how much money I had, to prove a council in Vietnam for my presence there. (Then I realized that it was not her business about my visa, etc.)  She was wasting time and we might miss our flight, we were hurry and she noticed that**. Considering our rush she was trying to charge 600 HK dollars for hand luggage** (the ticket cost around 500 HK Dollars). I was ready to pay but firstly I had to exchange currency. We didn't have much time and she said that it's 4 minutes left until the gates closed. OMG! She recommended going to a currency exchange and trying to pay the gates workers directly but it would be **800 HK dollars.** That was astonishing and insane. We rushed through the airport and finally got to the gate where we realized that the flight had been delayed. I acknowledged that the girl was trying to fool me knowing we could miss the flight. I got used to trusting people in Vietnam and didn't anticipate that it could happen to me here. What's wrong with HK people? Do you all treat foreigners like this? Moreover, the stewardess didn't give us 2 cups of water when we asked. We didn't eat or drink anything for all of this time and the only they could tell us was**: ""We don't serve water, but you can buy tea, juice, or bottled water, how would you like to pay?""** Excuse me? We don't have cash (only us dollars), and no credit card (we are Russians under the sanctions, so we don't have visa/mastercard) either pay or stay dehydrated. This is crazy. What if there are kids or disabled people on board? Would let them die? I WILL NEVER USE ''THE HONG KONG AIRWAYS LIMITED'' again!

377,Traveling to Hong Kong this Christmas Season... Any Recommendations?,"Hello!

My partner and I (Filipino and British) are travelling to Hong Kong on the 5th - 10th of December, 2024 for the first time! We are very excited to go to our first international trip together and as a planner, I am worrying that I might be missing anything even after extensive research!

Please take a look at our itinerary ✨ (We are staying in Sheung Wan area!)

DECEMBER 5 (THURSDAY):

MNL - HKG 8:10 AM Arrival

- Drop bags at Hotel
- Hong Kong Observation Wheel
- BigBus Kowloon Hop On-Hop Off Bus Tour
- Star Ferry (included in BigBus Tour Bus Package)
- Avenue of Stars
- Symphony of Lights
- Temple Street Night Market

DECEMBER 6 (FRIDAY):

- HKDL (Whole Day)
- Haidilao Causeway Bay (we unfortunately are a sucker for Haidilao, and has made it a mission to go to Haidilaos of places we visit!)

DECEMBER 7 (SATURDAY):

- Nngong Ping 360 &amp; Tai O Fishing Village
-- Free Afternoon/Evening --

DECEMBER 8 (SUNDAY):

- MACAU WHOLE DAY -

DECEMBER 9 (MONDAY):

- Ocean Park
- Peak Tram/Sky Terrace 428

DECEMBER 10 (TUESDAY):

- Sung Hing Restaurant
-- (Are they tourist-friendly? I have watched Bon Appetit's videos about Hong Kong and I would want to experience authentic dimsum before we go, but I'm afraid I do not know Cantonese 😭)

HKG - MNL 11:00 AM


PINNED FOOD PLACES:

- Tim Ho Wan (we have branches of Tim Ho Wan back in the PH — worth it to get it from HK?)
- Kam's Roast Goose
- Bakehouse
- Hing Kee Restaurant
- Dim Dim Sum

A couple of extra questions:

a. Is the Symphony of Lights worth it that we need to get a boat ride?

b. As a metformin gurlie™️, I will need toilets often. Are they easily accessible especially in touristy areas?

c. As it states on the Ocean Park website, the great panda exhibit will not be available ""until further notice"". Is it plausible that they'd be available then?

d. Any decorated places for Christmas that we need to check out?

e. Any food recommendations? Willing to hear out any suggestions 🫶🏽.

Any and all tips and recommendations are much appreciated! 🫡

I tried depositing enough money for my unpaid fare but its not automatically deducting from my account. Now I am back in Philippines and I don't know how to address this to the MTR customer service. My bank told me that it will not be charged into my account anymore as it is already a failed transaction. They advised me too to talk with mtr customer service.

# The Spin

# Anti-China narrative

This latest data paints a significantly pessimistic outlook compared to a July survey, which predicted 5.0% growth in 2024. The assumption currently is that China will miss its aim, falling to 4.8% in 2024 and maybe cooling further by 2025. The government is under pressure to implement new stimulus programs, while consumers are hoping for deflationary actions.

# Pro-China narrative

Despite a slower third quarter, China's economy still beat estimates and is on track to meet its 5% growth target. Economic growth remains at 4.8% year-over-year, and Beijing has taken adequate measures to boost consumer confidence. China can afford to expand at a slightly slower pace in the third quarter while still meeting its full-year growth objective.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1g781qu/china_q3_gdp_growth_slows_to_46/,self.HongKong,2024-10-19 13:43:20,DeepDreamerX,2024-10-19

Additionally, before the match, **police officers affixed at least three GoPro cameras to advertising boards near the pitch using tape**, allowing for wide-angle recording.

Prior to kick-off, the Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA) orchestrated the national anthem ceremony, first for the visiting Cambodian team, followed by the host team, China Hong Kong, playing ""March of the Volunteers,"" the national anthem of the People's Republic of China. **Plainclothes officers were seen filming the spectator areas with handheld cameras.** The GoPro cameras attached to the advertising boards were removed after the anthem concluded.

In June of this year, **three fans were arrested by police before Hong Kong's World Cup qualifier against Iran. They were accused of insulting the national anthem by turning their backs to the field and refusing to stand** during the anthem's playback.

The National Anthem Ordinance, which came into effect on June 12, 2020, prohibits distorting or demeaning performances of the national anthem, as well as other forms of insult to the anthem. According to the ordinance, **those convicted of insulting the national anthem face a maximum fine of HK$50,000 and up to three years in prison**.

488,Hong Kong doxing law - uneven/inconsistent enforcement by the PCPD?,"Has anyone had any experiences being doxed and worked with the PCPD (HK Privacy Commissioner) to try to remove doxing content from the internet? HK passed a very rigid anti-doxing law in 2021 and has hailed strict and rapid enforcement of the law since 2021 in press releases. But from my own experience, the PCPD has been extremely slow and despite all of their press releases saying that they take doxing seriously, their actual reaction to cases has been slow, quite weak, and they seem fairly selective of who they want to help. Apparently, the PCPD privacy commissioner has final authority on all doxing cases, so if they don't want to help you out, you're out of luck. I sometimes get the feeling they are looking for excuses to NOT help you if, they for whatever reason find your case ""trivial"", but the problem is I see cases equally ""trivial"" where they will go after the doxer to the full extent of the law and arrest them, so I'm concerned if there is selective enforcement/unequal protection of the law.

Apparently they can take very strong enforcement mechanisms including appealing to tech companies like Meta, Google, Microsoft (who have offices in HK) to force removal of doxing content, yet they seem very selective on whom they want to help out. Some cases involving very trivial doxing (like posting a simple name on Facebook after breaking up) between former lovers will get prosecuted while others, including mine which involve years of doxing and harassment, seem to get ignored. Not sure what's happening if they are just understaffed or something, but it's frustrating when people don't seem to get equal protection of the law. I've called the PCPD commissioner but I don't speak Cantonese (I speak English primarily), so I can't help wondering if there some selective enforcement to help HKner's who can speak Cantonese (I certainly hope this isn't the case).

500,Seeking Mandarin Experts for Open-Source Transliterator: Help Classify 23 Problematic Characters (Simplified &amp; Hong Kong-style Traditional Chinese),"# Project Overview

I'm an American app developer working on an open-source transliterator for Mandarin that converts any Chinese text into either simplified Mandarin or traditional Mandarin. Unlike tools like opencc, which requires prior knowledge of the text's origin script, my tool handles mixed scripts, replaces archaic characters with modern ones, and manages one-to-many character mappings more accurately.

# Need for Expertise

The code is complete, but I need help classifying 23 ""problem"" characters that my various sources (opencc and cedict) conflict on in order to improve the accuracy of the transliteration. I'm seeking an expert in hong kong-style traditional mandarin, to assist in this classification.

# How to Get Involved

If you're interested or know someone who could help, please comment and PM me for more details. The commitment is small—just a 15-30 minute call and possibly 2 hours of total work. This is an open source project, but I could send a small amount of compensation for the help.

The light quickly got brighter and turned red over about a few minutes. This light was stationary and was much too big and bright to be a star. This light remained for maybe three minutes unmoving in the sky. Then the light reduced and became dark. 
After 5 minutes more the whole thing repeated. This time I managed to call my son and his friends to see. They were also very confused about what we could see .

572,"Were Ken Takakura and Komaki Kurihara also popular in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the rest of the Sinosphere?","With all the rage about Alain Delon's death in the media and how every major website in the Sino world from Hong Kong newspapers' official websites to Taiwanese blogs and even Chinese diaspora living in other non-Western countries had written stuff in other languages such as Malay under web domains for their own languages (which would happen to include a couple of people of Chinese descent who don't know any Sino language such as Indonesian Chinese)....... Delon's passing was basically given focused everywhere in among Sino netizens and diaspora who forgotten to speak any Chinese language.

So it makes me want to ask...... I just watched Manhunt and Sandakan No. 8 two movies which are the top 3 highest grossing of all time in ticket admissions from Japan......... With over 80% of the sales coming from Chinese audiences! To the point that Manhunt is still the highest grossing foreign movie ever released in China and Sandakan 8 also still remains the runner up or 3rd place depending on the source you read. How much did they profit to be precise? Manhunt made over 300 million tickets sold in China (with some sources saying total market life time is close to a billion at over 800 million admissions!) while Sandakan is the 100 million sold tickets range.

And thus it should be obvious the leads of both movies Ken Takakura and Komaki Kurihara were catapulted to the top of the AAA list giants name within China with both stars getting a lot of their famous works from Japan dubbed into Chinese theatrical releases and later on Kurihara and Takakura would star as among the leads of their own Chinese-language productions. Up until his death Takakura would continiously receive media coverage from China and visit Beijing several times near the end of his life. The same happened to Kurhara except she visited China with more frequency since the late 80s coming back every now and then an to this day she still gets honorary visits from the Chinese industry and media, even a few politicians. Takakura was so beloved in China that when he died, the Chinese foreign ministry at the time praised him in an obituary for improving the relations between China and Japan.

For Komaki Kurhara, Sandakan No. 8 sped up in how the comfort women and other touchy topics regarding sexual assault esp rape by the Japanese army within China was approached by the general populace. As Wikipedia sums up, the struggles the movie's co-protagonist goes through was something the general mainland Chinese populace identified with in light of how an entire generation of the country suffered through the horrific Comfort Woman system Esp the human trafficking issue depicted in the movie.

So I'm wondering were Ken Takakura and Komaki Kurihara also household names in Taiwan and Hong Kong and the rest of the Sinosphere like Alain Delon was? I can't seem to find much info on them in Cantonese and Hokkien nor in the languages of places the Chinese diaspora frequently moves to across Asia such as Indonesian and Malaysia. So I'm wondering how well received where they in the rests of the Chinese-speaking world?",https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1g1nhgm/were_ken_takakura_and_komaki_kurihara_also/,self.HongKong,2024-10-12 00:48:03,UndeadRedditing,2024-10-12

I’m applying for extension under the top talent pass scheme if that matters, which requires submitting lots of additional documentation such as business plan, audited statements etc. My initial application took over their stated timeline and I had to call in to the immigration director several times to speed up the process. They also added in additional requirements like third party verification of education for extension and my original diploma is in another country.

The immigration officers checking my passport would take usually 5-15 mins on average to compare something and then pull out to one side and asked me to give them a few minutes to sort something out. Another 5-15 minutes would pass and they hand over my passport and said I'm free to go. No explanation, no apology, nothing. 

So I'm curious, has anyone experienced this before particularly at Hong Kong immigration? I don't experience this when I'm traveling to china via train or direct flights. It's only hongkong for some reason.

I’ve heard that cheaper tickets often sell out, and I’d prefer not to risk buying tickets on the spot and find that only the premium expensive ones are left.

Am I missing something, or is it simply not possible to buy roundtrip tickets online for the China Ferry Terminal to Macau Outer Ferry Terminal route?

Thanks all, and if ur still interested check the comments :)

I would like to send a urgent document to a financial institution in HK. However, DHL says that today's service has ended and the fastest would be the document arriving at 14th October.

The document is legal, but isn't confidential. The financial institution I'm dealing with does not seem to support fax. And I'd like the document to be delivered by tomorrow.

So, is there any possible way to send the document faster?

What I thought about is some entity in HK printing the document on my behalf, and sending it directly to the institution (which is located in Central, HK). Would it make any sense?

I’ve been thinking a lot about how it can sometimes be a little tricky to meet new people in Hong Kong—especially when you’re into things like tennis or basketball. I’m sure there are others out there who feel the same. I mean, it’s such a bustling city, but finding activity buddies isn’t always easy!

Recently, I’ve been exploring ways to make it simpler to find folks who are down for a game. A friend and I have been working on a tool to connect people who want to play, whether it’s tennis, basketball, or other activities. It's still in the works, but we’d love to hear your thoughts!

Anyone else feeling the same? How do you usually find people to play with? I’m curious to know if this is a common challenge or if there are hidden gems in the city for meeting people.

664,Home Return Permit question,"Hi. My mom is planning a trip to HK and China soon, and I am helping her apply for a Home Return Permit, but I am really confused. 

My mom was born in HK in the 50s and moved to the US in the 70s. She is a US citizen, lives in the US, and also has a HK Permanent Identity Card. Previously, she had a Home Return Permit, but that expired two years ago. Our goal is to renew her HRP. 

How do we renew her HRP? Can someone link me the relavent forms?

There's two places I found where she can apply.

(1) [https://www.ctshk.com/pass/nrep/bookmain.jsp](https://www.ctshk.com/pass/nrep/bookmain.jsp)

(2) [https://www.ctshk.com/mep/zh/apply-chinapermit-2/](https://www.ctshk.com/mep/zh/apply-chinapermit-2/)

I think the difference between these is (1) is for non-chinese citizens, and (2) is for chinese citizens. But here is why I'm really confused. When I go through (1) and try to renew her HRP, it won't let me because it requires the HRP to begin with HA, but hers begins with just H. (2) doesn't work because she's not a chinese citizen.

I'm just really confused at this process and was hoping someone has done this recently and can share some info. Thanks

665,Immigration Secondary inspection,"First of all, I want to be very clear that every country has its own rules, and we as visitors should respect and accept them without questioning. In May, after spending about 20 vacation days in South Korea, I (38M) from Argentina, and my girlfriend (28F) from Colombia, visited Hong Kong. We have been living together for five years, and once a year, we love to travel to countries in Asia. Last year, we visited Japan, and this year it was South Korea and Hong Kong.

After a pleasant flight with Cathay Pacific, we landed in Hong Kong—one of my childhood dreams was coming true. We headed to immigration, where we handed our passports (Argentinian and Colombian) to the officer. Without saying a word, the officer began checking them. I have many stamps from the USA, Spain, Egypt, Colombia, Russia, and Japan (I’m a frequent leisure/business traveler). My girlfriend, on the other hand, had just renewed her passport for this trip and only had the South Korea landing permission stamp.

After a few minutes, another officer approached us with a rectangular piece of paper and asked us to follow her. Very politely, she explained that they wanted to ask some additional questions as part of a normal procedure. Before heading to the secondary inspection room, she took my passport, asked me to wait a few minutes, and returned with my landing slip, telling me, “You can go and wait for her outside if you want to pick up your luggage.”

However, my girlfriend was taken to the secondary inspection room, where another officer asked her several questions about her residency (she resides in Argentina but is Colombian), the purpose of the trip, places we planned to visit, our itinerary, hotel reservations, her job, her salary, my salary (I was outside at the time), her credit cards, and why she had a month of vacation (we both work in IT and have flexible vacation policies). After about 45 minutes, she was given her passport back and allowed to enter Hong Kong.

After that, we had an amazing time in Hong Kong, exploring the city for six days, taking great photos, going on adventures, and doing some fun shopping.

When it was time to fly back, we checked in normally, dropped off our luggage, and received our boarding passes. At immigration, we handed our passports to the officer, who didn’t ask any questions but took another rectangular piece of paper and started taking notes on my passport. Another officer seemed particularly interested in my Egypt visa (I visited the pyramids in 2019 with my family as part of a vacation trip). The two officers discussed something for about five minutes, after which I was allowed to leave Hong Kong and board my plane. No further issues occurred.

This was the first time something like this happened to me, and while I did feel a bit scared, I try to respect the rules of every country I visit. I always aim to be polite and cooperative with the officers, as it’s their job and I understand that. I’m just curious about what could have triggered this situation. I’ve visited many countries, including those in the European Union, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, and India, without any issues. Neither of us has a criminal record or even any fines.

That said, we truly enjoyed Hong Kong. The officers were very polite, and we had a wonderful time. We’re dreaming of coming back one day. We loved the culture, the people, and the city—this is just a matter of curiosity.

690,Family or Fertility? Hong Kong Court Grapples with Public Housing Eligibility,"**Hong Kong's Top Court Hears Appeal on LGBTQ+ Housing Rights**

**The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal heard arguments Friday in a landmark case challenging the exclusion of same-sex couples from public housing policies.** The case, which has far-reaching implications for LGBTQ+ rights in the city, centers on whether the Housing Authority's current policies discriminate against same-sex partners.

Two same-sex couples initiated judicial reviews after being denied the right to apply for public housing as families. Lower courts ruled in favor of the couples, prompting the government to appeal to the city's highest court.

**Representing the Housing Authority, King's Counsel Monica Carss-Frisk argued that the current policy, which recognizes only heterosexual marriages, supports ""family aims"" and encourages ""natural procreation"" to address Hong Kong's aging population challenge.**

However, the court engaged in a pointed exchange that highlighted potential inconsistencies in this argument. **Chief Justice Andrew Cheung Kui-nung (張舉能) questioned whether childless heterosexual couples could still apply for public housing as spouses. Carss-Frisk confirmed they could, asserting that the Housing Authority must consider the overall situation and reiterating that heterosexual couples have more ""potential"" for procreation.**

**In a moment that drew attention, Justice Joseph Paul Fok (霍兆剛) then posed a thought-provoking question: ""By that logic, wouldn't a lesbian couple have even more procreative potential than a heterosexual couple?"" Carss-Frisk conceded that while the line drawn might not be perfect, the Housing Authority needed to establish eligibility criteria somewhere.**

**Arguing for the same-sex couples, King's Counsel Timothy Otty countered that the Housing Authority's policy lacks a rational connection to its stated ""family aims."" He emphasized that some heterosexual couples may choose not to have children, while same-sex couples can pursue various paths to parenthood, including adoption and assisted reproduction.**

Otty further argued that same-sex partnerships are equally capable of forming stable, committed relationships with mutual respect and have the same housing needs as heterosexual couples. He stressed that the law does not guarantee specific waiting times for public housing for any group, and that these are subject to supply and demand.

**The Court of Final Appeal has reserved its judgment, with a ruling expected at a later date.**

705,Moving to Hong Kong: Seeking Advice on Which Sports Gear to Bring,"Hi everyone,

My family and I are relocating to Hong Kong soon, and we’re trying to decide what sports equipment to take with us. Here in Germany, we have a large house with plenty of storage space for our gear, including bikes and skateboards, but we know that space will be much more limited in HK.

We’re very active and want to keep up our hobbies as much as possible. One of our favorite activities is gravel riding, but it seems like there aren’t many gravel roads in Hong Kong. Is it worth bringing my gravel bike, or should I consider switching to a road bike since I’ve heard there’s a decent road biking scene there?

Our kids also have their own bikes, which they love to ride. Are there safe roads or designated areas in Hong Kong where kids can cycle? We want to make sure it’s worth bringing their bikes, too.

We’re also big into surf skating as a family and have about 10 skateboards, which we use to cruise around streets and at skate parks with bowls and pump tracks. I know surf skating is gaining popularity in mainland China, but how about Hong Kong? Is it worth bringing our entire collection, or would we be better off being more selective?

Lastly, we’re snowboarders as well. From what I’ve read, the go-to snowboarding destination for people in HK is Japan. Given the limited space we’ll have, do you think it’s worth bringing our two snowboards along, or would it be more practical to rent when we travel?

I’d really appreciate any advice or insights, especially from people who have experience living an active lifestyle in Hong Kong!

I was born and raised in HK to a Chinese family but speak English as a first language because I went to international school. I am near fluent in Cantonese but I’d prefer a mostly anglophone environment first and foremost. I don’t drink or club often and don’t like getting drunk. Just enough to relax is good enough for me. I mostly listen to pop music and I’m not picky with drinks, though that’s because I don’t drink often enough to have any preferences. I usually stick to cocktails and get something sweet with a low alcohol content.

Sometimes I go to Meetup app group events but a lot of the groups have been established a long time ago. The people there are friendly, but usually over ten years older than me. I have a close group of high school friends but most have immigrated and it’s been very difficult to branch out.

She is a Hong Kong native and, though we’d originally planned on settling in the UK after she very recently finished studying her Master’s degree, she understandably would like to be closer to friends and loved ones.

My work experience thus far is rooted in Oracle QA testing and system optimisation on the human capital management side, and my employer has made clear that an international transfer could be facilitated of I request to do so. My salary is currently **£33,000/HK$336,448** per annum but, having never negotiated an expat package before, I am unsure whether this is subject to being uplifted in view of Hong Kong’s cost of living.

While Hong Kong does sound like it has changed a lot in recent years, I do still think it looks like beautiful place with a lot to offer both locals and expats alike.

I think it's also important to note that, for the longest time, I've generally tried my best to make the wisest possible decisions and for the past two years I've lived a simple, peaceful life in my small town in the north of England which revolves around working, boxing and spending time with the people I love. I don't want to look back and wonder what could have been had I just taken a risk though, so with this in mind I could use some advice on the following questions:

* What should I apply for before moving to Hong Kong with my employer’s support?
* What are some other need-to-know differences between the UK and Hong Kong?
* Any tips for negotiating an expat package?
* Is it likely that my salary will be uplifted to match the cost of living in Hong Kong?
* What would be considered a comfortable salary for two young professionals in Hong Kong?
* What are your recommended residential areas?
* Are there any tips or useful information I should know when it comes to getting around the country?
* Are there many boxing gyms in Hong Kong?
* Am I ultimately crazy for considering this?

I've added more content, so hope its entertaining.

I haven't had such a great user experience using 28hse, or spacious for that matter, so made a new listing site, designed with user experience in mind. But of course, I can't be developing it in isolation. I've had a few friends test it out, but what I really need are people who are actually looking for flats at the moment, to test it out. Currently, the listings are all from various facebook pages, added there. Filter'able by price, location, and feature, eg ""rooftop"". It's nothing groundbreaking. 

So if anyone here is flat hunting, would appreciate you guys give it a go, and let me know! I'm not taking any commissions on this, and all conversations open a direct message via whatsapp with the agent. Site is [flathunt.co](https://flathunt.co)

- Initial feedback I've gotten and have fixed(or at least I think I have) are, images load slow.

738,Autistic 21-Year-Old Sentenced to 8 Weeks in Prison for Disrespecting China's National Anthem,"A **21-year-old man with autism** was sentenced to **8 weeks in prison** in Hong Kong for disrespecting China's national anthem during a volleyball match in June 2023. The young man allegedly *booed, gave a thumbs-down gesture, and sang ""Do You Hear the People Sing?""* while the anthem played.

During his testimony, the defendant explained that he dislikes Disney due to its ""imperialism."" On the day of the incident, he saw many spectators wearing Disney clothing or carrying Disney bags. He gave them thumbs-down gestures because they supported the Chinese team, and he wanted to oppose them.

The defense argued that the young man's **autism and ADHD could cause uncontrolled reactions to stimuli**, suggesting his actions weren't intentional. They also noted that he had *waved a Chinese flag in Victoria Park on June 3rd, indicating his behavior wasn't anti-national*.

**Despite these arguments, the court ruled his actions were deliberate and violated the national anthem law.**

I am currently still getting my tour guide license and building out my platform, I won’t be publishing much here as I don’t want to self promote much. 

While doing that, I do want to get some training so I would love to see if anyone is currently in Hong Kong or looking to visit Hong Kong in the next month or two, I would love to provide a few tours for free! 

Just reach out and I’d be happy to curate something based on your needs. All I would ask in return is for you to cover your own expenses ie any food or tickets, I will cover my own costs and won’t be expecting anything in return (feedback will be appreciated haha)

801,"Kuen, Hold On. (Reflections on Press Freedom in Hong Kong. Author: Margaret Ng)","[Snapshot of the newspaper column published in Mingpao Daily written by Margaret Ng, 30 September 2024.](https://preview.redd.it/fptyb89yxyrd1.jpg?width=1049&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=728529a1b59d7d4fc025f32c5785ee1e2f9d141e)



Kuen, Hold On

Originally, the chances of acquittal weren't particularly good. The practical advice was to plead guilty for a one-third sentence reduction. Coupled with time already served on remand, the remaining days in prison wouldn't be too many. **But this chap wouldn't have it, for he wanted to clearly articulate his convictions about journalistic work.** So he endured a protracted trial, leaving behind a detailed public record of the boundaries of press freedom under today's laws. He was willing to hold on, only worrying that he hadn't spoken well enough or clearly enough.

This fellow, tall and lean, was paradoxically born with a bull-headed determination. In those days, online media wasn't widely accepted yet; the public hadn't realised how crucial it would become one day. Accustomed to accessing content online for free, the news outlet he edited gradually faced financial difficulties. **He held on, forgoing his own salary.** His colleagues worked overtime without complaint, but as the person in charge, he couldn't help but feel despondent. I, a nominal director, lacked both the financial means and business acumen to be of much help.

A senior figure advised him to rationally narrow down the scope of reporting, concentrating limited resources on certain service areas. **He was surprised and bewildered, refusing to consider it: What meaning would there be in journalism then? Was that all the team's contribution amounted to? So he pressed on.** Finally, during a public event of some social movement, he sheepishly attempted crowdfunding. Standing beside him, I watched ordinary citizens, one after another, stuffing money into our donation box. He was as excited as a child, simply because he directly felt the readers' enthusiasm and approval.

Later on, later on, the situation became increasingly grim. Everyone grew more and more worried, but news and information became even more crucial. **He held on until the very last moment.** Afterwards, as they say, what happened next is history. No one can fathom what spiritual strength allowed him to calmly face 21 months of lost freedom. Perhaps he doesn't need external support to hold on, but we now yearn from the depths of our hearts to hold him up. **Why don't we, over these 300-odd days, take turns in relay, drafting a news article each day, storing them up, and when the time comes for reunion, bind them into a volume for him, as if submitting homework?** Kuen, hold on, we hold onto your convictions, we hold onto you.

I am currently on an H1B visa in the United States. I need to return to Hong Kong to have my in person interview and have my visa stamped this December. I have a flight back to HK on Dec 12.

On their website, I only see dates available up until December 6, and it has been like this for the last several months. 

Does anyone know or has anyone ever scheduled an interview at the US consulate in the middle of December in past years???  Is it possible they end interviews for the year that early?

I tried calling the consulate, but no one on the customer service line was able to answer this question for me and told me to simply wait and see if more dates are posted later on.

My concern is that potentially the United States consulate will not hold any interviews after December 6 for the rest of the year due to the holiday season, but I have no one who can confirm this information . Wondering if anyone here on this Reddit has firsthand experience or knowledge about this? When does consulate typically release more dates? Need to figure out how to rearrange my trip with my work schedule if the consulate does not plan to hold any interviews past Dec 6.

Any help is appreciated!!

863,Are you allowed to bring this into Hong Kong? (Alka-Seitzer Plus Cold and Flu Medication),"Hi! My friend from the US is going to HK for the first time and he is freaking out about immigration. He read up that sleeping pills are not allowed in HK without a prescription, but he usually takes Alka-Seitzer Plus to help him with jetlag (he has only been to Germany for a few days before). I told him Alka-Seitzer Plus is a cold and flu medication and it's technically not a sleeping pill or the higher class drugs like benzodiazepines, anxiolytics etc even though it helps to get him drowsy. 

He has decided to still not being the cold and flu med anyway because he doesn't want to 'take the risk'. I think he's being far too paranoid, but please correct me if I'm wrong. The active ingredients are: 
• aspirin 
• chlorpheniramine maleate (antihistamine) 
• dextromethorphan HBr (cough suppressant) 
• phenylephrine bitartrate (nasal congestant) 

He has actually asked me to bring it for him instead if I insist the meds are fine (I'm from Australia) because he's American. He said he just doesn't want to run into any problems at immigration because he's American, and wants it to be as smooth as possible. 

Can we actually buy this over the counter in Hong Kong (whatever the equivalent brand is)? I'm thinking of buying it there since I'm flying today and may not have time to drop by a pharmacy.

877,Singaporean moving to Hong Kong in 2025,"Hi everyone!

I have been given the opportunity for a move to my company's Hong Kong office in January next year. I have been living in Singapore my entire life, this will be my first time in Hong Kong and relocating for work as well. I believe I will be here for 2 years minimum.

I will be receiving my new contract for the relocation and I am unsure of what to look out for. Apart from that, I am also unsure of what kind of housing I should opt for.

Housing: Studio? 1 bedroom? Serviced apartment?

Location: My office is located near Quarry Bay, Eastern District of Hong Kong Island.

Rent: Assuming my company is sponsoring me \~USD 3k for rent, where would be ideal?

Also, what should I look out for in my contract to ensure that I am not being shortchanged? I would have to take into account that I have only been working 9 months in this company (first job) as I only graduated last year.

I would appreciate anyone's help at this point, especially from Singaporeans that have moved to Hong Kong. Feel free to use this space to share some tips and experiences besides the ones that I have mentioned above.

885,iPhone 16 Pro - different chip?,"Hi,

I bought an iPhone 16 pro from Hong Kong thanks to my gf’s parents. They have now told me that the phone might have a different “Chinese AI”, and that it won’t work in UK and Europe where I live and regularly go, due to a different chip.

I have tried to find information online, but nothing confirms what they said, in regards to the AI. It’s unclear whether I would have access to some GPS functions or whether I could use FaceTime and AirPlay.

I haven’t gotten my hands on the phone yet, and obviously Apple Intelligence won’t be available until at least December. I live in the UK and I plan to use the phone here as well as in Italy.

They’re suggesting that I should return the phone instead of keeping it, but to me this sounds quite unreasonable considering there’s no information about some updates as of yet. 

However, recognising my lack of specific knowledge vs people from Hong Kong, I thought I could ask someone else if they have information about this.

Thank you all.

909,Looking for recommendations for activities for a family with a young child in Hong Kong ,"In November I will visit Hong Kong again after years of absence. Since my last visit a lot has happened. I am married now, have a son of almost two years old. For my wife this will be the first time in Hong Kong and of course also for my son because of his young age. 

I still have some family living in Hong Kong so I definitely plan to meet up with them. However, I decided to stay in a hotel in the Mong Kok area to be well central in Hong Kong. I also prefer to stay in Kowloon as my childhood was mainly in Wong Tai Sin where my grandmother lived. 

Now my question, where before I always found my own way and could go where I wanted, will I now travel for the first time with the focus on the well-being of my wife and son.
Are there any special places that I definitely should not forget to visit that are also aimed at young children. I am looking for good playgrounds. For example, I came across moko park. If I'm not mistaken, there are also shopping centers that are aimed for children.

So I would be helped with good recommendations that can be combined well for a family with a young child. Which are easily accessible with a stroller and where there also good sanitary facilities are available.  

Due to the special nature of the trip, a high budget will be made available for activities and we will stay in Hong Kong for more than two and a half weeks. (from November 17 to December 5) The preference for transportation will be via mtr.  Perhaps this is also important to mention for possible recommendations.

921,When History Meets Politics: UK Historian's Hong Kong Visit Sparks Controversy Over Historical Truth and Political Influence,"**Robert Bickers, Co-Director of the Hong Kong History Centre at the University of Bristol**, has found himself at the center of a heated academic debate following his visit to the Hong Kong Chronicles Institute. The controversy erupted after the Centre introduced the visit on its Facebook page yesterday, exposing deep rifts in the scholarly community and raising questions about the role of historical interpretation in contemporary politics and justice.

The visit drew sharp criticism, particularly from Dr. Kim Wah Chung (鍾劍華博士), a Hong Kong scholar who has moved to the UK. In an exclusive email obtained by media, Dr. Chung described the visit as a **""scandal"" that is ""disappointing and in fact very disgusting.""** Critics view the visit as **tacit endorsement of an institution they accuse of reshaping Hong Kong's history to align with Chinese Communist Party narratives.**

Dr. Chung **likened the Hong Kong Chronicles Institute to the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell's ""1984,""** suggesting **its primary purpose is to distort Hong Kong's history to fit the ideological and political propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party.**

At the heart of the controversy is Professor Lau Chi-pang (劉智鵬) of Lingnan University, associated with the Institute. **Lau's expert testimony in court, asserting that the term 'liberation' has consistently meant reclaiming lost territory or power for nearly a thousand years, reportedly contributed to a young person's nine-year imprisonment.** This has intensified concerns about the **weaponization of historical scholarship in legal and political arenas.** Dr. Chung **accused Lau of acting as a mouthpiece for Beijing's autocratic regime.**

The situation has ignited a broader discussion on academic integrity and the responsibilities of international institutions when engaging with politically sensitive contexts. Dr. Chung argues that **as a UK academic entity, this visit is completely unacceptable and cannot be justified in the name of academic exchange, communication, or relationship building.** He **advises others to refrain from participating in the HK History Centre's activities** until it provides an acceptable clarification and commits to a more academically trustworthy orientation.

As the debate unfolds, some have responded with satirical content. A reader sent in a photo using the official visit photo, overlaid with Chinese Communist Party-style red background and simplified Chinese characters in yellow, reading **""Lau Chi-pang's Historical Thought Symposium Successfully Held! Overseas Scholars Bathed in Spring Breeze.""** The image's propagandistic flavor and satirical tone are quite evident.
