5,Transit Visa: the applicability to my imagined itinerary,"Hi, I'm Japanese and I feel a bit sad that the gov't of the CPC will obstinately not allow Japanese citizens' visa-free entry.

however, transit visa-free entry still remains available to Japanese people, and the requirement for its use is of course to use China's main cities as transfer point to third countries, and those permitted to enter can't go farther beyond the designated metropolitan area of each city.

Though aeroplanes are regarded as main manner to visit and leave China, I think it can meet the entry scheme's terms and conditions to use high speed rails to HK west kowloon, which is considered to be a ""departure from mainland jurisdiction"".

Have you ever tried this itinerary with that entry qualification?

6,15-day visa free experience on german passport,"Went to china on a german passport using the 15 day visa free policy.

Before boarding in switzerland the airline did a sort or passport ""pre check"" to make sure you actually have a chance of getting entry into china. There i was asked to show a return flight.

After landing in Shanghai we exited the plane and went to straight to the entry area. Collect your fingerprints at one of the machines (machines had instructions in perfect english) then we were given blue landing cards to fill in. 
Going to immigration there was an officer checking the blue cards, he told you if you did something wrong or missed something. He asked me to add my phone number.

Actual immigration desk asked no further questions. I had to give my passport, the blue card and the fingerprint ticket. They took a photo, checked fingerprints again and then looked through my passport and stamped it. Everything took about 10 minutes total.
No hotel bookings or flight tickets were asked. 

Same with customs. Just put your bag through the scanner and they did not say anything and then we were in.

24,The Chinese high school math prodigy Jiang ping (ÂßúËêç) story turned out to be a flop,"tldr: Alibaba held annual math competition, in this year's 1st round, a high schooler named Jiang Ping(to be accurate, a 17 years old student from a secondary technical school) from a relatively undeveloped area, who study ""fashion design"" at school, placed a very high score on the board, beating students from top universities math major.

Suddenly, her story was all over China: a fashion major technical school student placed high rank on a math competition where top universities students are the usual contenders. She became the perfect math Cinderella story, not only beating top universities math major students, but also, being a female, in a male dominated competition. Praise followed by questions, as people wonder if her score was legit, and how she could compete in a math competition that required highly specialized math software and a personal computer, which she own neither. Against all the questions, Jiang Ping proceed to participate in the final round of the competition.

After almost half an year later, the official investigation from alibaba found out that her ""score was obtained illegally with the help of another individual"", but didn't specify who. Her school also released a notification punishing her math teacher who is possibly the one that actually participated under her name. Alibaba also post the final rank where Jiang Ping didn't score any place.

39,What they are teaching kids in China,"Translated from a tweet

I saw a Japanese media report yesterday that Japanese schools in Shanghai, Shenzhen and other places in China decided to have a day off on December 13 this year. Because this day is the ""Nanjing Massacre Memorial Day"" designated by the Chinese government, large-scale commemorative activities will be held in Nanjing and other places. Television media will also criticize Japanese militarism in various forms.

Anti-Japanese sentiment is rising in China. Japanese schools, school administrators and parents everywhere are afraid that Japanese children will be attacked again. So we decided to have a holiday on December 13th.

Since June last year, incidents surrounding Japanese schools have occurred one after another. For example, in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, a Japanese mother and son were attacked and injured while waiting for a pick-up bus; and on September 18, in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, a boy was attending school. He was attacked and died on the way. As for these two incidents, China considers them to be ""accidental incidents"" and says they were not targeted at the Japanese. So far, no details of the case have been provided to Japan. As a result, many Japanese company employees working in China had no choice but to send their children back to Japan to study.

In Chinese schools, children are taught anti-Japanese hatred from an early age. Therefore, the Internet in China is full of messages such as ""I would rather have no grass growing in China, and we must recover the Diaoyu Islands"" and ""I would rather have graves everywhere in China, and we must kill all the Japanese."" ‚Äù and other extreme slogans.

In fact, it is not just Japanese children who are targeted in China. On October 28, a man stabbed people with a knife at the gate of Zhongguancun No. 3 Primary School, a famous elite primary school in Haidian District, Beijing, injuring five people, including three children.

In addition, there have been many attacks on primary school students recently, and the prisoners are basically middle-aged unemployed men. A Japanese reporter interviewed Beijing residents. Many interviewees explained that ""Nowadays, social pressure is high, living costs are high, and more and more people who cannot survive are going to extremes."" Regarding this answer, many Japanese media people expressed disbelief.

Because in 2021, the Chinese government held a national summary and commendation conference for poverty alleviation in Beijing. At the meeting, Xi Jinping solemnly announced to the world that all 98.99 million rural poor people under the current poverty line have been lifted out of poverty, creating a ""miracle on earth."" Why is it that just three years have passed and there are more and more poor people in China?",https://x.com/yaita_akio/status/1852145248144937388?s=46&amp;t=AaZYo71rlrK2q6iaqzf3Qw,x.com,2024-11-02 18:19:10,Real-chocobo,2024-11-02

Does anybody know for sure can I bring two pieces of checked-in baggage? I'm confused as their website clearly says I can bring only one piece, but every other place on their website and on ticket it says I can bring two pieces.

52,Language barrier is such a struggle for me to make friends with the local people.,"So i came to China a year ago to study Mandarin and I started almost from nothing. This year i joined university and i started to realize that i‚Äôm struggling so much to catch what my Chinese colleagues are talking about. There‚Äôs one day when i hung out with my Chinese band colleagues, they‚Äôre saying things back and forth while i just sit there trying to understand. I felt like an outsider and it makes me anxious since then.

I feel the worst especially when I hung out with my orchestra band colleagues. As a girl, girls are so much easier to talk to even though i don‚Äôt understand them too sometimes. However the guys are sooooooo much harder to approach. It feels like they have no interest in making friends, or even just talk with me (does it have anything to do with their socializing culture?). It‚Äôs not easy because the band are filled with mostly guys, so i always feel lonely and awkward on rehearsals üò≠üò≠ they crack jokes but i can‚Äôt understand wth they just said üò≠ i want band friends too‚Ä¶..ü•≤ 

Chinese is my third language and to be honest it‚Äôs pretty bad :( I feel like i‚Äôm not me when i‚Äôm speaking Chinese, and i feel like i‚Äôm the driest person ever to talk to with because i can‚Äôt express myself in it. I became very bad with finding topics or hold a conversation, because my brain backflips constantly when i talk with them.

I want to be able to socialize with people and share humors with them just like when i‚Äôm speaking English (which is also not my first language). Does anyone have ever experienced this? Do you have any advice to give? Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1ghsv8p/language_barrier_is_such_a_struggle_for_me_to/,self.China,2024-11-02 09:42:15,really-tired-pianist,2024-11-02

I am a Finnish international relations student looking to go on either an exchange semester next autumn, or full year exchange. Feel free to also share your opinion on if a full year or just a semester would be better!

I am completely set on Asia, as I am looking to learn the local language and continue working with the area in the future, while also experiencing a completely different culture and life. Now, my university only offers two universities in Asia: Fudan University in Shanghai, and City University of Hong Kong. I have already studied a bit of Mandarin, which would make learning the language in Shanghai a bit easier. Mandarin is also more useful as it has more speakers, of course. Shanghai would also be a lot more affordable. I have however also heard a lot of great experiences of doing an exchange semester in Hong Kong, while I personally don't know anyone who was in Shanghai.

I am looking to travel around Asia during my exchange, and intensively study the language and culture, not really to just party. Feel free to tell me your thoughts :)

85,Who is China's equivalent of Feli From Germany?,"This video best sums up who this Feli From Germany lady is.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnN10ETi1kQ

If you're not getting the hint already from the video, Feli From Germany is a Youtuber currently living in America who makes Youtube content about life in Germany and often compares it to life in the USA. She touches various different stuff from daily cultural norms to intro stuff about the big companies and businesses of Germany and so much more. Every other week she'll post a video about the German language and its basic rules like how to pronounce words correctly and pointing out how Americans get it wrong, basic conjugation rules, etc nothing too complicated but enough for people unfamiliar with German culture to learn stuff about. She'll also do a video every once in a blue moon comparing Germany with Austria and Switzerland about various different subjects like different accents of the places or the differences in food, sometimes she'll even touch within Austria and Switzerland the different regional varieties of various aspects like architecture and folklore (which she already does plenty of concerning just Germany alone).

So I'm wondering who'd be the China's version of Feli? Preferably if possible a Youtuber content who's not only quite active enough to upload at least one new vid a week but also had lived in America, if not even actually living there right now just like Feli? Hopefully diverse enough in discussed subjects to even do some content every now and then about Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore and other parts of the Sinosphere outside of China as well as the Chinese diaspora outside the traditional Sino world such as the Orang Tionghoa and the Tsinoy along with American Chinatowns?

105,My recent visit to China literally gave me a life-time PTSD,"**Edit 3: I am very suprised that I had to tell many users who praised the healthcare of China that China has more cities apart from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The population of these 4 tier one cities is only 80 million in total, while China has 1.4 billion people. You cannot use your experience in the top 5% to demonstrate quality medical services in China.**

Edit 2: no, I am not affected by active users from r/China_irl or r/sino, beacause I knew who they are and what they are going to say. You cannot wake a person who is pretending to be asleep.

Edit: I fixed some grammar and spelling issues. It was hard to concentrate while writing such a story.

For the sake of the people still living in China, I'm not going to reveal many details, as anyone who is not naive knows that the CCP is very good at witch-hunting and has been shameless in this regard.

Recently, I visited China again after many years because a family member was dying. They had been diagnosed with a terminal disease several years ago, but all the doctors refused to help since then. The original words were like "" such a chronic condition wouldn't develop fast"". Well, guess it was not the case later.

*I somehow understood that Chinese doctors had their own reasons/concerns, such as avoiding the doctor-patient disputes, which are very common in China. Also, I hate to express it, but many Chinese doctors will try to persuade the patient's family to give up on terminal diseases, as ""it is wasting the money"". I am not going to talk about it too much here, as it needs a new post to make people understand how bad the situation could be.*

Back to the story, when I booked my trip in a hurry and eventually visited them, their condition was far worse than I had imagined. The affected body part was literally rotten, and it stank. Visitors had to wear masks; otherwise, it was hard not to throw up.

The patient also believed in some ‚Äúwitchcraft‚Äù- level remedies, and trying those only made their condition worse, considering doctors all could not do anything to help. It happened when a person was so desperate that they would seek every bit of opportunity for a cure. People who have not suffered from this cannot understand why they could do such irrational things - such kind of long-term diseases can easily destroy one's faith and common sense.

Did we try ‚Äúterminal care‚Äù? Of course we did, but they were just connected to various tubes and asked to undergo a hundred irrelevant tests - the hospitals were trying to milk us for as much money as they could before the patient died. *The problem with these doctors were, they would not offer pain relief or qualify of life solutions either, because terminal care is probably too advanced/high-end in China still.* To make the matter worse, nobody in the family was an expert in the medical field.

Eventually, after several weeks of torture for everyone, including the patient, they passed away. The dying family member had begged us countless times to help them end their suffering, but how could we do that? Before their death, the unbearable pain even made them curse a family member who had been taking care of them for months! I couldn't believe my ears when I heard those harsh words.

Now you may think this was the end of the story, but the local government still wanted to complicate matters as much as they could. The deceased had made a coffin for their planned burial, but it had been banned months ago in their area. You needed to pay someone to remove it from the warehouse, and I don't want to repeat the horrendous process -

*An update here: the local government would collect all coffins at a low price, but you had to pay to have a coffin transported to their location. However, the local government was also selling coffins at double the price to nearby areas where burial was allowed. You can judge for yourself: was the local government doing this for the sake of land use?*

That was just one of the many miserable stories under China's ""moderately prosperous society in all respects,"" which is absolutely ridiculous propaganda. I bet for ordinary people, only those who are brainwashed by the CCP or have Stockholm Syndrome would praise it. I am not sure if foreigners can receive better quality medical care in China, but for civilians, having any critical disease is a nightmare for their whole family. We all understand that this (the healthcare system) is just the tip of the iceberg.

My entry to China wasn't pleasant either. I was asked a hundred questions about whom I was visiting, when, where, and why. My non-Chinese passport was examined so carefully, as if I were a spy. Oh, and of course, ten fingerprints had to be recorded for several rounds.

As a side note, during a formal dinner for a medical professional who once saved the life of another family member, it was beyond frustrating to hear them talk about how much gay people disgusted them and how little they could tolerate gay relationships. That said, when China wasn't called China, the hate against LGBT was not so fierce as today.

In the end, the necessary visit to China successfully planted a seed of various negative feelings in my mind, and I am still heartbroken while writing this post.",https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1ggsywx/my_recent_visit_to_china_literally_gave_me_a/,self.China,2024-11-01 00:12:50,Aidenfred,2024-11-01

this is a draft of the itinerary

  
day 1 - emei mount

day 2 - half day leshan and train to chengdu and then to kunming

day 3 - kunming to lijiang

day 4 - jade dragon snow mountain

day 5 - tiger leap gorge

day 6 - lijiang shaxi

day 7 - shaxi dali

day 8 - dali kunming

day 9 - kunming chendgu

day 10 - chengdou jiuzhaigou

day 11 - jiuzhaigou

day 12 - jiuzhaigou chengdu and panda reserve in the afternoon

one more day where?



i have this time of visit

lijiang: one day three nights

shaxi: one day one night

dali: one day one night

kunming: two nights and half day to visit stone forest

juizhaighou: one day and half



my questions are the following.

**1.** is it possible to sleep close to emei or leshan the night, visiting half day buddha the next day and taking the trains to chengdu and then to kunming in the afternoon?

**2.** is it possible on the same day going back from jiuzhaigou to chengdu and visit a panda reserve in the afternoon?

**3.** i have an extra day. what place do you recommend other?

164,Sent money to Supplier in China using exchange shop. Now they're getting questioned by police?,"Needed to send ¬•100,000 to a supplier in China. I couldn't send a wire using a bank in HK because the recipient and sender must be the same beneficiary. However I could send to a company account but the supplier doesn't have a company account. And a HK company account can't send to a mainland personal account. Can't use alipay because alipay is for small sums of money. So used an exchange shop in HK. I gave the shop HK dollars, they convert and deposit to the bank account on the mainland. This was a year ago. 

Suddenly now that supplier has his bank account frozen, his money confiscated, can't withdraw anything, and is getting calls from public security bureaus from four different provinces across China. Saying that the money they received last year is illegal gambling money. They now have to go to court and show them documents like invoices and purchase orders amongst more, and they're going to name me as their buyer. Because the money was broken into multiple small payments, the suspected transactions correlates with my payments to them, so it is definitely from my payment via the exchange shop.

When I go to the exchange shop they say they can't do anything, that it's normal, etc. This is a nightmare for my supplier guy. Anyone been through this situation? Any way to solve this issue?

199,Are Chinese women living in China more family / kid oriented than Chinese women living in the west? ,"So for some background, I'm a 29 year old,  successful software engineer living in the SF bay area in California. 6 feet, jewish background. Have a nice car, dress nicely with designer clothes, in shape, etc. I get many matches and dates from Hinge or other apps from Chinese women around my age that are born in China, and moved here for education and work. When I say many, I mean I have been on maybe 10-15 first dates , and several that lasted longer over several months. 

I don't have an issue with being a provider and paying for most things. However, one consistent issue I have noticed with this group of women is that, they are extremely career/education oriented and not really kid oriented. What I mean by that is, despite being between say 28-32, they don't see having kids for another 4-5 years, with some even requiring a surrogate to carry babies instead. and in general they take dating VERY slowly. I mean like even 5-6 dates before a kiss on the lips. They seem to be very reserved relative to Hispanic women or Asian American women, or women from other Asian countries.

My concern is, that I might be judging an entire population (one of the most populous on Earth), by a small subset of them able to immigrate and study in the USA, which may not be representative of the whole.

213,Xi-jin ping is an idiot,"as a leader, he could conquer russia and have an infinite supply of oil if he chose to partner with the west. instead he is focused on an island, with very little resources, that arguably wants independence. 

He could expand china's territory while Putin's army is at its weakest point, hailing him as a hero in america and all over europe for standing up against putin. Not to mention he could double or triple china's land mass and spread his population across the continent.

Xi has a once in a lifetime chance to end the cold war era of post soviet russia, but instead he is going to crash the entire economy by arresting all the investment bankers and taking over taiwan with 1/3 of the u.s. GDP being produced from it. if he takes the island, does he think america will still import from them? does he think the trade war will get better? all the investment bankers of the world are invested in Nvidia and taiwan semi: once he invades stock prices will drop like a rock and global investment will be gone.

as one of the super powers of the current world, china has the ability to start a landgrab that possibly changes the fate of his country, yet his military advisors are blind.

He is like the panda, lathargic and stupid. he is going to make his population extinct. he sits in his tree eating bambu, thinking he is the apex predator. meanwhile the dogs are fighting, the wolves are howling, the coyotes are packing together and making a plan.

221,Layover in Beijing and visiting the Great wall of China,"Hi, so on 4.11. i will have a 15 hour layover at PEK airport, and I'm wondering if there is a way to travel to the Great wall of China in that time. I arrive in China at 3:35 and have a departing flight at 18:45. I saw that getting the visa exemption takes about 2 or 2.5 hours and I need to be back at the airport 2 hours in advance, so that leaves me with about 11 hours of spare time.

What is the best way to get to the Great wall, I saw online that taking a taxi from the airport is around 800-1000RMB (I don't know if this is one way or return trip). Since I'm travelling alone this is a bit out of the budget, so I'm wondering if there are any other cheaper ways to get there, maybe something like group tours. I also considered travelling by bus or train. I checked on rome2rio and I saw one way trip takes about 2.5-3.5 hours depending on the section. I will post links to routes here:

[https://www.rome2rio.com/map/Beijing-Capital-Airport-PEK/Great-wall-of-China#trips/transport/Beijing-Capital-Airport-PEK/Great-wall-of-China/r/Bus](https://www.rome2rio.com/map/Beijing-Capital-Airport-PEK/Great-wall-of-China#trips/transport/Beijing-Capital-Airport-PEK/Great-wall-of-China/r/Bus)

Is it possible to visit the wall by these buses and trains and get back to the airport in time or is it risky. I also saw that there can be a lot of traffic during the day so I'm worried about traffic jams and buses not arriving on time.

I'm wondering if it's feasible to go and visit the great wall or should i rather head into city. I know since I'm traveling there on a Monday the Forbidden city will be closed so I'm wondering what other things other than Tiananmen Square i should visit.

On a bit of an unrelated note, I'm wondering if I can pay in most places (including transport) with Wise debit card or do I need to setup a Alipay account.

Both are taboo on Turkish television and essentially as offensive as the F word or ""tsao ni ma bi"".

In American culture, both of these have completely inoffensive meanings: the OK sign literally is used as a non verbal equivalent of ""okay"", and the thumbs up has an ambiguous but positive meaning that ranges from ""awesome"" to ""thank you"" to ""cleared for take-off"".

276,Working in China in IT or making my business ,"Hey people,

My GF is from China and we live in Germany. Things have been going well but her desire is to come back to her home country at some point.

I have lived 3 months in Wuhan before COVID for an internship and I really like China. I also went back 1 month last year to travel around. I work at SAP a big German IT company and I see that they have offices in China but I'm quite not sure that they will accept to transfer me. I don't really speak Chinese, I speak many languages including English, French, German and Spanish but my Chinese is really not good enough. I was wondering if it was still easy for me to find a job in China or not ? I've looked a lot and it seems that many companies are still offering jobs without any Chinese needed but is it really the case ? And what about the working conditions? SAP Germany is known to be very generous and it's pretty chill but any idea about China? I did my internship in a Chinese company and it was pretty intense. (Not for me, I didn't do anything, but for me Chinese colleagues).

I'm not looking for a English teacher job, I'm not a native speaker anyway. 

Also, since I'm from Belgium, I would also like to do a Belgian waffle store in a city like Chengdu or Chingdao, where people are very chill. I feel like seeing a Belgian white guy serving authentic Belgian waffles would be a good ""attraction"" in china and that it could work pretty well. Has any of you have experience with opening a business in china ? I'd open it with my Chinese gf so I don't really need to speak Chinese at first I guess, I'd just make the waffles and serve them.

Thank you

277,"When typing Chinese script on cellphones, does Latin letters get written first and then automatically converted into Chinese characters?","I started watching Amidst a Snowstorm of Love, a Chinese fictional TV show about Billiards, and one thing I notice so far is that when characters are texting on their phones, they first write words in Latin alphabet and it automatically gets converted into Chinese script as soon as they finish typing each word before hitting space to type the next word. The words are basically spelled in Latin script the same as in Pinyin as featured in your common Chinese-English dictionary and study books.

I'm wondering is this basically the norm for writing on your phones in modern China esp on when texting? Does it work the same for Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other places in the Sinosphere that doesn't use Mandarin as the primary language when communicating with typed words on phones?",https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1gb3hm2/when_typing_chinese_script_on_cellphones_does/,self.China,2024-10-24 15:08:31,UndeadRedditing,2024-10-24

280,Ghost Films.,"This is a bit of a lost media type thing. Ok so years ago British TV channel, Channel 4 showed a series of Chinese ghost films, this is how I remember them being described I could be wrong. Anyway in one of these 'ghost films' there was a scene were 2 young Chinese folk, like say around 20, 1 male 1 female, were having tea with a British person, like in the British guys home. Anyway, they saw the British guy putting cream in his tea, which confused them as Chinese don't put cream in their tea, I guess? Not to get bogged down in details, but neither do we, we put milk in our tea. So the 2 Chinese folk, just decide to take their lead from the Brit and do what he was doing. So, we get to the bit as to why it's stuck in my head, the British guy gives them each a custard tart, and the Chinese guy put cream on top of his custard tart and stirs it with a spoon. The thing is I didn't realise until a few years later that there is a type of Chinese custard tart/bun. I had Chinese friends growing up in Liverpool, and we'd always go in to Liverpool's China town to eat on a Sunday night, the restaurant we went to, sold custard buns, but only on a Sunday, and they were always sold out by the time we got there. So anyway, here's my question, does anyone have any idea what film it was.",https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1gb0m6p/ghost_films/,self.China,2024-10-24 12:43:47,silbervogei,2024-10-24

How many of you has gone through similar experiences?

I recall many times seeing elderly people say to a child ‚Äúwhy you still so small? You not able to grow up?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy you so fat? Your parents feed you so much?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy you so skinny?, your parents doesn‚Äôt feed you enough?‚Äù

The one I remember the most was then an auntie came to visit my home, once I saw her of course I gave her my greetings and she started yelling

 ‚Äúhey! You so tiny!! Aren‚Äôt you able to grown up!?‚Äù But the Cantonese tone she used was so rude (ÂñÇÔºÅÊÄªÁ≥ªÁîòÂüÉÂä†‰Ω†Ôºü‰Ω†ÂîîÂæóÂ§ßÂä†Âí©ÔºüÔºâ

I didn‚Äôt know what to answer so my mom asked me why I‚Äôm not answering when someone talking to me and the auntie immediately said

 ‚Äúhahaha todays children‚Äôs are all like that, they don‚Äôt know about anything about respect and education‚Äù

After that auntie left the house my mom started to yell at me complaining how failure I was as a human and when I decided to better leave the place the last image I remember was my mother angry face glaring at me, I turned into the bad mannered and insolent child without saying nor doing anything just because that b*tch auntie‚Äôs comment

Now as an adult, last week I got into a similar situation with my son, we went to the bank and in the line we saw another Chinese old man, and as most of the Chinese do when meeting each other in another country, we greet each other, and he asked my son age and I answered that four years and he started to laugh and said 

‚ÄúFour years?? He is so tiny! Aren‚Äôt he able to grown up!!?‚Äù (With the same words that auntie used back then)

But I just reacted saying ‚Äúwhat the hell are you talking about? Aren‚Äôt average childrens like that?‚Äù

And then I decided to stop interacting with him and continue to play with my son while we was on the line and looks like he didn‚Äôt dare to say anything else",https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1gasbzc/elderly_unclesaunties_that_like_to_humiliate/,self.China,2024-10-24 03:32:47,el_redditor_papucho,2024-10-24

321,‚ö†Ô∏è Beware of Dangerous or Fake Products! ‚ö†Ô∏è,"
I recently purchased a 150 ŒºF, 450V AC start capacitor for my air compressor from ""ÊãºÂ§öÂ§ö"" (China) - ""Temu"" (Canada) while my wife was visiting her family. 
When I plugged it in and turned on the compressor, the capacitor started smoking within a minute!  Luckily, there was no explosion, as the two **DC-rated electrolytic capacitors** inside were sealed in a plastic container with some kind of adhesive. Still, this was a major safety hazard!

After opening it up, I discovered the capacitor contained two DC capacitors (470 ŒºF and 390 ŒºF, 200V each) soldered together, which are completely inappropriate for AC use. The actual capacitance was 860 ŒºF, not the 150 ŒºF labeled on the product. This kind of setup is dangerous, as DC electrolytic capacitors are not made for AC circuits‚Äîthey can overheat, fail, and even explode.

I‚Äôm sharing this to warn others: 
Be careful when buying electrical components online, especially from platforms like ÊãºÂ§öÂ§ö/Temu. Always check the product thoroughly, and if something seems off, don't risk it. 

Stay safe and always double-check your purchases!

322,Shipping a care package with snacks ,"I live in the USA and made friends through networking with my business with a Chinese citizen. 

We often talk about food in our respective countries. And I had the idea of us exchanging packages with various prepackaged, factory sealed food items from our respective countries. Including some items I know we both have but like the packaging and/or are curious of any taste/texture differences. For instance, this started cause of Oreos. I posted a photo of Oreos here and she responded with what her packaging looks like. It's silly. But go with me here. It's my autism talking üòÖ

So I know shipping to China will be ""fun"" but I'm willing to bite the bullet. I originally wanted to send her gator jerky (I'm in Florida) but learned no meat (understandably) so we are sticking to snack foods, candies, maybe a cereal and/or snack cakes.

In America SnapOn tools are found in almost all mechanic shops. I would say 95% of American Mechanics own at least one SnapOn tool. The company is so large in America that they have tool salesmen that travel from mechanic shop to mechanic shop selling tools to mechanics. They even give the mechanics a credit line so they can buy tools and pay for them slowly. 

Is there anything similar to this in china? A tool company that dominates the vehicle service industry? 

As an American I had a notion that industries in china were fragmented, disorganized, and produced low quality products,  but after watching many videos on YouTube I realized that it's the opposite. I would love to find some good high quality Chinese tools for my little workshop. The SnapOn stuff is ridiculously expensive.

343,Chinese men's social status,"First of all, this is not a troll post, but a rather serious (and respectful) attempt at discussing a real issue.¬†

Based on my observation (and personal experience) over the past 15 years, it has come to my sad realization that Chinese men especially in urban settings have been faced with widespread and systematic discrimination and oppression, in the following ways:

1. In the work place, men are almost always asked to do more work, the dirty work, pull all-nighters, night shifts. ¬†Managers tend to hesitate before asking female employees to do anything hard/challenging. ¬†Female employees often feel justified in acting rude to managers as if talking to their husbands.¬†

2.¬† From elementary schools, high schools to college, teachers routinely and consistently require boys to do manual labor but spare the girls. ¬†In fact, even years after they graduate and have a reunion, guys are often asked to split the bill while girls don‚Äôt need to pay (they call it Áî∑AÂ•≥ÂÖç) even when nothing romantic is involved.¬†

3. In relationships/marriages, in most Chinese cities, especially economically developed regions such as in the Yangtze Delta and Pearl Delta, men are generally exploited significantly. iPhones, LVs', Gucci's, Chanels are very commonly required. In fact, China has been the world's top 1-2 markets for luxury goods for multiple years in a row. Men are generally expected to pay for all spending in a relationship. Some men refuse to pay, but are generally ridiculed or attacked on social media or otherwise on the internet (girls even coined a term for this ‚ÄúÁôΩÂ´ñ‚ÄùÔºå which literally means getting a hooker without paying). We are not even talking about hot women here, just regular ones. Wives verbally abusing husbands is generally accepted.¬† In the annual Êò•ÊôöÔºài.e. the China Central TV New Year Gala, which is watched by most people in China, think Super Bowl on steroidsÔºâ, almost every year there will be depiction of physical abuse by women on men, such as twisting their ears, forcing them to kneel on a wash board, etc. See [https://puui.qpic.cn/vpic\_cover/r33622wjkn4/r33622wjkn4\_1667826611\_hz.jpg/1280](https://puui.qpic.cn/vpic_cover/r33622wjkn4/r33622wjkn4_1667826611_hz.jpg/1280) [https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-e41fb64e1c0c8f037bb5ed69efa56d89\_r.jpg](https://pic2.zhimg.com/v2-e41fb64e1c0c8f037bb5ed69efa56d89_r.jpg) Financially it‚Äôs not much better, most families practice ‚ÄúÂ∑•ËµÑ‰∏ä‰∫§‚Äù, i.e., husbands have to submit all their income to the wife, and the wife may refund a small amount of pocket money for bus fare and possibly cigarettes.¬† In fact, e-commerce conglomerates have done extensive research that show women control 80%+ of spending in Chinese families. ¬†The following wide spread photo shows less money is spent on men than women, kids, elderly, or pets. ¬†[http://img.mp.itc.cn/upload/20170620/c3cf91cf585d4d6fb282086f0c2b51b7\_th.jpg](http://img.mp.itc.cn/upload/20170620/c3cf91cf585d4d6fb282086f0c2b51b7_th.jpg)

4. In the legal system, men are also treated completely differently than women for the same crimes (a guy slapped his high school teacher in the face for past bullying and was sentenced to 1.5yrs in jail, while a female motorist who drove against traffic and hit a male motorist in the face with a GPS holder causing bleeding, was detained for 10 days and fined USD150 only. See [https://news.sina.com.cn/c/2024-09-02/doc-incmtrws1260627.shtml](https://news.sina.com.cn/c/2024-09-02/doc-incmtrws1260627.shtml) In another case an unprovoked female customer stabbing a taxi driver with a knife was let go with just an apology). In fact, lots of crimes are almost exclusively committed by women especially pregnant women because they know nothing will happen to them (go to any random street overpass in a Chinese city, chances are there will be some pregnant woman selling fake government invoices (for tax evasion purposes)). ¬†This is coupled with the fact that 60%+ of new hires are female in our court and prosecution systems over the past 10+ years.

(see https://www.spp.gov.cn/spp/zdgz/202303/t20230304\_605949.shtml).¬†

5. This is related to 4, but warrants its own item -- men are victims of wide spread domestic abuse with no help from any law enforcement agencies. Men hitting women are generally punished very severely but women hitting men are almost never prosecuted at all. ¬†In fact, this has lead to the wide belief that women can freely hit men with zero consequences. I met several women that were like that. One of my ex'es hit me very hard once during an argument, so I called cops who refused to do anything (I am a much stronger/bigger individual but I have a career so fighting back wasn't an option). ¬†My eye sight was impaired for several weeks from this attack. This happened in one of China‚Äôs most developed and wealthiest cities. The cop flat out told me that unless I lose a limb or something like that, they are not going to do anything(I am happy to give you details of this incident via DM, including the identity of the police station involved). ¬†In more remote and less developed regions, it‚Äôs possible for men may be more violent, but there are very few women left -- they all went to cities.

6. Some say it's a matter of social status, but that's not true. China has a fair number of Kevin Spaceys and Johnny Depps. ¬†Tycoons are forced to apologize all the time, for stating basic facts that offended women.

7. Social benefits.¬† Women start enjoying retirement benefits at 55 while men at 60.¬† This coupled with the fact that Chinese men die 6 years earlier than women (according to UN/WHO stats), shows how little credit the system gives men.¬† Plus, the majority of college admission is granted to women since 2009.¬†

Honestly, it‚Äôs pretty shitty deal to be a guy in China these days.¬† Some of these issues are also going on in the West (and are not talked about enough either) but some are unique to China.¬† ¬†

Interestingly, a good portion of the US $1.6bn ‚Äúcognitive warfare‚Äù budget goes to spreading the myth is women are oppressed in China. ¬†I mean, out of all those easy targets out there, why pick this one?¬† ¬†¬†",https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1g98w7x/chinese_mens_social_status/,self.China,2024-10-22 04:31:52,BennyTN,2024-10-22

But to put things into perspective, are people aware that China has about 1.4b people and is the 2nd largest country in the world and the US has about 335m and 3rd largest?

If China loses 77% of their population today, they'll still be be as big as the US which is still the 3rd largest country in the world. Why is no one talking about that? In fact China is so overcrowded and competition is so high that in chinas eyes it's actually probably somewhat  healthy to shed about 100m-200m people especially of poor rural and elder population which will put a strain on the entire economy. In fact, If they can keep growing their nominal gdp and shrink their population a little bit, generally that will increase their per capita gdp and make everyone a bit richer.

351,"Is there a difference between a triade, a sworn brotherhood and Tiandihui?","I hope I can find any sinologist or a specialist here.

I am a Ukrainian historian, who works with the security service archives, and the object of my research is the chinese diaspora in Ukraine. After researching almost 50-ish files of repressed chinese, the puzzle began to assemble - it looks like these guys had a very complex net of drug dealers and currency smugglers all over the soviet union, and particularly in Ukraine. I am referring to the interrogation protocols, where the NKVD detectives ask them about participation in an ""anti soviet pro-japanist espionage secret organizations"" called Khe Tou and Dziebashinde (literally that's what they wrote there, there was not a unified transcription system from chinese back then). The arrested chinese were explaining that those are simply sworn brotherhoods, that are customary to Chinese culture and their goal is to simply unite and help out each other. Later they are briefly describing some rituals such as appointing an elder one and writing their names with blood on a piece of paper. I was able to somehow decipher the terms used by Chinese in the protocols: Á£ïÂ§¥ÁöÑ or Á£ïËøáÂ§¥ÁöÑ , which, i assume, means an oath, a form of a secret society, especially common among Chinese in the Far East of Russia, and ÁµêÊãúÂÖÑÂºü - the soviet detective assumed it was the name of their organization, but in fact it means ""sworn brotherhood"" in general.

Now, the question: considering that these people were engaged in illegal activities, yet were keeping low profile, pretending to be usual people, what was it? Could I refer to this form of organization as Tiandihui, or it's a quite a narrow term? Or it was rather a sworn brotherhood or secret organization? Is there a difference between a triade and a secret brotherhood, Tiandihui?

At about 8 pm on October 14, several Chinese students living in the airport dorm were attacked on their way back to the dorm after shopping in a nearby supermarket.

Two Russians stopped them and asked for their passports, but they were neither wearing police uniforms nor showing their identity.

When the students asked if they were police officers, the students were suddenly attacked with pepper spray, then pushed to the ground and beaten by the Russians. 

Several students were injured to varying degrees, one of whom was seriously injured. 

After learning the news, the Federation of Chinese Students of Russia rushed to the hospital to learn about the situation.

Similar attacks have occurred in several Russian cities. Due to insufficient local monitoring facilities, police response efficiency is low and it is difficult to obtain timely help when encountering danger. 

In the end, the Federation of Chinese Students told  Chinese students to ‚Äúbe sure to pay special attention to your own safety.‚Äù

Looking for some more firsthand information about Guangzhou. Originally was considering living in Hangzhou , Suzhou, Nanjing, etc. (I have many friends in Shanghai and I love the plethora of green space &amp; nature in this cities). However, the job search is looking difficult (American English teacher w 5 years of TEFL experience but I‚Äôm black so) been getting shafted for any schools that aren‚Äôt kindergartens and training centers. 

Still might move there if something pans out before February, but I wanted to have backups to apply for. I know Guangzhou would be a good backup option, however, the one thing I need is green space. Just large parks or something green to look at/ live nearby that‚Äôs not urban cityscape or artificial, small city park feel. 

This might be a reach but‚Äî is there anywhere in Guangzhou that‚Äôs like this? Maybe suburbs or certain districts of the city? Also, what is the average rent for a 3 bedroom apartment? Is there any diversity in the hiring processes there usually? Any insight (if you *actually* have experience) would be great. Also, if you have any other cities you recommend that fit, please lmk üòä my most important things are: 
- small to medium expat community 
- Western food easily available 
- Green space

398,Visiting China in January,"I will visit China in January, which is my first trip there. I want any suggestions or advice to make my journey easier or safer. What are some things I should look out for? I intend to be in Beijing. The last thing I want to have to happen is accidentally upset the authorities because of my ignorance.

The purpose behind the trip is to experience Chinese New Year in China and meet with a woman I've been having regular video calls with for the past year. Since the intent is to meet with a person in person for the first time, any advice on something trustworthy, like a background check service, would be great. I hate to sound paranoid, but when traveling to the other side of the world, one can't be too safe, I suppose.

Edit: Yes, I know meeting someone from another country is weird and risky. I've done it in the past, and I haven't had any bad experiences. That said, I'm going into this super carefully. The trip is primarily to see the Chinese New Year in China. Meeting a nice woman would be a bonus, but I know it's a very real possibility I will be spending the new year alone.

400,How WeChat's Translation Button Made My Time in China Easier,"I'm a foodie and I always order food delivery when I travel to China. As everyone may have known, WeChat mini program is essential when you want to order food delivery in China. 

Yesterday, I found out that WeChat added a new translation feature directly into its Mini Programs. 

This feature is really simple to use‚Äîthere‚Äôs now a ‚Äútranslation button‚Äù at the top of the page. You tap it, and the text content gets translated into your language instantly.

Despite some formatting issues and hilarious translation of the dish names, it worked pretty smoothly. The whole menu was translated right there on the screen, which made ordering so much easier. I‚Äôve also used it a couple of times while shopping to understand product descriptions, and it‚Äôs been super helpful for those everyday situations where I‚Äôd normally be stuck guessing.

Has anyone else tried it? Any funny translations to share? Curious how it‚Äôs working for others!For those who don't know how to activate it.

422,Questin: do you feel this is offensive? (Q inside),"Hey Community,

I am from Austria and I have a HipHop Band. We make easy listening, fun rap. One of my colleagues wrote a new text for an upcoming project. There is one line, which i‚Äòd like to get your feedback on. 

In Austrian-German-Slang:
BennoB, wie er bumzua flaniert /
Wie in China in da Kuchl, weil der Hund ist paniert 

In english:
BennoB (that‚Äôs me) is completely wasted / 
Like in chinas kitchen, he‚Äòs a crispy fried dog (or breaded dog)

I‚Äôll explain the meaning:
In Austria we say ‚Äûpaniert‚Äú if something is breaded, as in for example crispy fried duck or whatever.
We also say ‚Äûpaniert‚Äú if somebody is drunk/wasted.

We also say call our peers ‚ÄûHund‚Äú (=dog) just like we would say dude or friend or similar.

So the joke is: he insults me that I am very drunk and makes a reference to Chinese Food. But since he says Chinas kitchen fries. dog I am unsure if this is racist or not. I‚Äòd argue yes, because dog is not something you typically make crispy fried (breaded). What is your stance on this? 

I hope you understand the question! 
Thank you in advance for your input!

453,"thoughts on ""let it rot""","just now, I came across a video about Chinese non-elite university students' letting it rot, which made me think that the so-called bai lan actually comes from a strategy used in NBA, which is actually called tanking, i.e., certain teams will lose deliberately to have a better chance of getting 1st pick in NBA draft. 
At first, I was thinking that it's funny that English have words/phrases like that, for example, Anime actually is Japanese for animation, but English used it as a new word specifically for Japanese animation.
well, although weird at first glance, it makes sense, because ""let it rot"" is very different from tanking in NBA, ""let it rot"" is a self-destruction strategy in the sense that it won't bring you better chance of doing anything, but it can also be viewed as a self-salvation, because people are so exhausted by this system that they choose to take some rest, or in the contemporary China's context, ""to rot"".

btw, this is why Chinese people choose song chi(instead of other words like cong rong) to describe a state of people where you don't feel pressured and genuinely happy, because in this system, people are like pipleline workers in Modern Times, more like a part of machine, not human.

460,The problem with Chinese netizens,"They are mostly made out of two groups: 1. parents around 40 to 50, and 2. students around 12 years old. These two groups of people are what some people call : ""patriot monkeys/village people"" and I don't blame them for being called that. They think of China like god and they believe all of western culture are stolen from China because they keep thinking about the infamous Bri'ish Museum. These stubborn netizens belittle everything that is not Chinese or it's allies'. The 1st group, the parents say that everything from the western culture, like video games, cosplay(which ain't even western), manga/anime is dangerous for their children and call them ""culturual invasion"". They also have a great hatred for Japan that I can very much understand, but sometimes they bring it too far. Examples are when a vlogger goes to Japan for a tour and they post a video of it someone in the comment section is bound to say:""Â¥áÊ¥ãÂ™öÂ§ñÔºå‰ª•ÂêéÂà´Âõû‰∏≠ÂõΩÔºåËøÅÁßªÊîøÂ∫úÂèñÊ∂àÁ≠æËØÅ""(translation: obsessed with western culture, don't come to China again, the government should delete your passport.) Speaking of politics these people can comment something related to politics under a video that has nothing to do with politics. These people also post without thinking, which makes their comments very funny to read. The students will brainlessly follow their parents and start to say stuff like: ""Japan should be bombed 1000000000 times!"" or ""China military crush the evil US and NATO!"". Overall you get the point, they are STUPID.

However, not all netizens are like this. Many other netizens take a thoughtful approach towards topics involving China vs other nations or politics in general. Although they are right the stubborn netizens will accuse them of being not patriotic and supporter of western power. IDK why I made this post, maybe it is because I have been on the Chinese short videos platform for too long and I can't read any more of the non-sense.

This is because that ethnic minorities get benefits (such as more easy access to university). I also met half manchu/han people whi listed themselves as manchu to get those benefits (i wonder if there some people are listed as an ethnic minority because their great great grandparent was one) Apparently ethnic Kazakhs and uyghurs get the most of these benefits. I saw a livestream of ADVchina which showed what they said was a Han chinese man speaking (even tho the man said he was uyghur). So I wonder if most of the ethnic minorities are just han people listing themselves an ethnic minority (or have a very distant ancestor) just to get benefits. This means that places like Xinjiang and inner mongolia are  much more han dominated than statistics show (I wonder what the true stats are like, would it possible to provide a guesstimate?).

Option 2 would be going to Zhangjiajie for maybe 3-4 days

Option 3 would be Guilin/Yangshuo area

I am not too worried about speaking/understanding Chinese for the most part. I‚Äôm not sure how I will do with different accents/dialects.

I plan to do one destination with my partner, and one destination solo (26F). My family is rly worried about my safety doing solo travel in China. For their peace of mind, I sort of have to find a tour group or guide for the ""solo"" segment. So any tips in this regard would also be very much appreciatedüòä

482,I just write a Guide to 2024 Shanghai Halloween Parade :),"[https://shanghaipubcrawl.com/guide-to-2024-shanghais-halloween-street-parade/](https://shanghaipubcrawl.com/guide-to-2024-shanghais-halloween-street-parade/)

oh why no Social Media Cards, let me paste the text here without photos and videos:

**Guide to 2024 Shanghai Halloween Parade**

Every year on Halloween, various businesses hold activities, with Shanghai Disneyland and Happy Valley hosting the largest events. However, the most attractive, creative, and popular is the Halloween street parade organized spontaneously by Shanghai residents. People gather annually at Found 158 for various cosplay activities.

Why Found 158? It used to be Shanghai‚Äôs most famous nightlife hotspot (although it‚Äôs not as popular as before since the COVID-19 pandemic). It‚Äôs a sunken plaza with many bars and nightclubs, featuring an open-plan design that facilitates mingling and socializing. The bar customer highly overlaps with the young crowd that enjoys Halloween, making it the liveliest spot for Halloween celebrations each year.

It‚Äôs unclear when this spontaneous event began, but it went viral during Halloween in October 2023, as that year marked the official end of pandemic restrictions in China. This event, paused for two years (there was a small-scale event in 2022 due to pandemic controls), attracted many young people and spread widely on social media, bringing it to the attention of many non-local residents.

As a result, for Halloween in October 2024, many visitors from outside Shanghai plan to participate.

If you want to experience the Halloween atmosphere in Shanghai, I suggest heading out on October 25, 26 Friday and Saturday. The 25th and 26th will be the busiest days as the weekend before Halloween is always the most bustling. This coincides with the peak hours of Shanghai's nightlife‚Äîcrowds start growing at around 7 or 8 PM, peaking from midnight to 2 AM, and winding down by 3 or 4 AM the next morning. (So if you have work the next day, many choose to stay home.)

You can visit the following areas for the best experience:

* 1 Found 158 - This is the busiest spot. Go early to avoid being locked out due to crowd control measures.
* 2 and 3 - These are other nightlife hotspots where crowds gather.

Other roads marked in red will also have heavy foot traffic.

A few tips:

1. The internet can be very slow in the Found 158 area when it‚Äôs crowded, possibly leaving you without a connection.
2. Bring a power bank. Frequent photo taking, video recording, and poor signal can drain your battery quickly.
3. From midnight to around 3 AM, it can be very difficult to get a taxi in this area, so be prepared to wait in line for half an hour or more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1g4sefp/i_just_write_a_guide_to_2024_shanghai_halloween/,self.China,2024-10-16 06:47:37,Invisible-cloak,2024-10-16

505,"China economy is going to crash if it starts to bump property price up, and there aren't any property tax.","China economy is going to continue to crash if property price goes up again, and there's no property tax. The current price-to-income ratio is 20-30.

China seems to reverse their stance on making property price to fall, they want the price to stabilize and rise in the long term. But I think this is going to be a toxic medicine.

This is because with a falling property market, people generally felt ""poorer"" and cut their spending and economy becomes bad in general. Thus China wants to stimulate economy by making people feel ""wealthy"" again.

The problem is, even after this devastating property price drop, the property average price-to-income ratio in China is still 20-30, even in poorer cities. In simpler words, citizens need 20-30 years of salary to purchase a home. To compare, US has an average ratio of 4 and New York is 10, most European countries is 5-10 as well.

So bumping the property market isn't a healthy solution in the long-run, teaching Chinese citizens to long-term invest in stocks will be, if the main goal is to make citizens feel ""wealthy"" and spending more.

In addition, China doesn't have a property tax like United States, so China cannot charge properties at a 1-2% yearly tax on their net worth. So even if property prices go up, it won't really benefit the government much, nor citizens (Because most people own and live in 1 home).

I understand the difficulty faced by the Chinese government, because there are too many stakeholders on high property prices, it's impossible to just make property price fall to a 5-10 price-to-income ratio in short term. However, this will be at the expense of everybody, including homeowners.

510,China‚Äôs Large Tiltrotor Drone Breaks Cover,"China has revealed the first example of a new tiltrotor drone, United Aircraft‚Äôs R6000. The drone is notably large, providing a very useful load-carrying capability, and relatively offering high-speed and long-range,  demonstrating China‚Äôs technological ambitions in aviation.

[ the first completed UR6000 prototype on the production line in Wuhu, Anhui](https://preview.redd.it/o4r9o5c0ntud1.png?width=1022&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=856fd933ae587d6915be9e0f25c421c7575a5c1e)

The R6000‚Äôs architecture includes an innovative design, featuring a straight, top-mounted wing and two vertical tails that enhance aerodynamics in horizontal flight and stability during vertical flight transitions. United Aircraft has kept the engines confidential, though the propulsion system is reported to include a variable-speed gearbox to adjust thrust between vertical and horizontal flight modes.

Perhaps the most striking aspect of the UR6000 is its size. United Aircraft has released some provisional specifications for the tiltrotor drone. These include a maximum takeoff weight of 13,448 pounds (6,100 kilograms), a payload capacity of 4,409 pounds (2,000 kilograms), a cruise speed of 432 miles an hour (550 kilometers an hour), a service ceiling of 25,000 feet (7,620 meters), and a maximum range of 932 miles (1,500 kilometers). 

https://preview.redd.it/4eymvsg7qtud1.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dea4dce68e92c721cfda2344a4b3795dcd405f91

The R6000, also referred to as the UR6000 or Lanying (lanthanum shadow), was displayed in a commercial livery at the Singapore Airshow, underscoring its initial role for civilian applications. However, images on United Aircraft‚Äôs website also show the UAV in the livery of the Chinese Air Force, an acknowledgment of the military-civil integration policy encouraged by the company. According to a United Aircraft representative, the tiltrotor is primarily designed for civilian operations.

A tiltrotor drone, in particular, could well be suitable for a range of missions, especially in the Indo-Pacific theater, in which access to conventional airstrips would likely be limited in wartime and there is an enduring requirement to deliver cargoes to remote locations like Chinese island outposts in the South China Sea. While the U.S. military is increasingly looking at how to best address expeditionary missions in this environment, it‚Äôs also of huge importance for the PLA, as it seeks to expand its reach across the Pacific, including operations from small island airstrips as well as a growing fleet of amphibious assault ships that would be ideal platforms for the UR6000.",https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1g3wi3r/chinas_large_tiltrotor_drone_breaks_cover/,self.China,2024-10-15 02:37:15,Frozen_light6329,2024-10-15

What the hell??

At a total loss for what to do. I use timeouts and take away their play time five minutes at a time for each incident and also use rewards incentivising good behavior. Of course I talk to them each time for each incident, too.

None of it seems to be motivating them very much one way or another.

The main thing is I've never seen this kind of thing before. The head teacher doesn't seem to be bothered by any of it. Just so long as nothing leaves a mark and no admin sees, she talks to them semi-seriously and thats it. If it wasn't for me, they'd have no punishment at all!

Legal work is only work done for the company sponsoring your work visa at the exact address specified on the permit. You do not have to receive any money for it to be classed as ""work"".

But where is the line drawn? Here are some examples, some of them are real situations I've witnessed, some are made up. Which ones would be illegal work? And is there a legal document in China where the exact line is defined? 

- Your Chinese wife owns and runs an expat bar. Your name is the name of the bar. You don't work at the bar, you're a kindergarten teacher. But you are at the bar every night and greet guests.

- Your Chinese wife's family owns a farm. You are employed as a teacher. During holidays you help on the farm. Your Chinese family member gives you some cash for helping. 

- You have some job in China. You have a friend that runs a business selling something. You make a douyin video with him to advertise his business.

- You are employed in China. You run a YouTube channel and get paid by YouTube. 

- You are employed in China. You sell things on taobao.

- You are employed as a teacher in China. You are married to a Chinese woman, her aunt asks you to help tutor her son in English. She may or may not give you some cash for your trouble, or take you out for a meal. (this is a good one since tutoring English is illegal under double reduction, someone who works as a teacher doing private tutoring work on the side is double illegal. So where would the line be drawn between helping a family member and breaking the law). 

- You are employed in China. The local government tells your employer they need a white face and to send someone. Your are sent to a government building where you film some video about how awesome it is being a foreigner in China or something.

My story is nothing special. Me, European, male, 28, went to China for study from 2018 to 2020. I was in Nanjing University, passed my HSK6 in less than six months. Loved the city, loved the atmosphere. Back then sure, I didn't have a lot of pressure on my shoulders.

Last year, I went to Tianjin. Even though my Chinese was fluent (I passed my HSK6 in 2019, whatever, HSK6 is barely conversational level of Chinese and I am way above it), I felt so depressed. I've lived in a province level town in Russia for about a year, and I feel there were many more activities than in Tianjin. I was, like, okay, my sure-fire go to in China is to speak Chinese, cook and love the food. No. People had not interest whatsoever in socialicing. They didn't.... Okay, like they didn't even conceive to have public spaces to socialize!

I then tried to discover a little bit more of northern China. Hebei, Henan, they were like alien territory to me. Beijing was almost okay.

565,Query Regarding Dummy Tickets for Visa ,"Hey, 

I (28 F Indian) wants to travel to China this December. I am thinking about doing a circuit (Delhi - Hong Kong - China - Vietnam - Delhi) for 2 weeks. I plan to visit China (Beijing + Shanghai) for 4-5 days. 

Prior to this I have traveled to UAE, Thailand, Indonesia. 

I am working professional and have a stable regular income, maintained bank balance and all other documents. 

My query is regarding Dummy Tickets. If I should use this for my China Tourist Visa? 

I used dummy tickets while applying for a Shengen Visa this year and it got rejected so I am very sceptical to use it. Since there are no direct flights from India to China. If I book flights from Hong Kong - Beijing and then Shanghai to - Hanoi including the refund ones the airline is still charging a lot - Total INR 14k approx. USD 165.

581,Do not work for Henan University of Science and Technology,"Do not work for Henan University of Science and Technology.

All of the below information comes from a group of friends who made the mistake of moving to the lovely city of Luoyang and working for Henan University of Science and Technology.

Let‚Äôs begin with the most basic issue: salary.  
The university advertises salary in a certain way, I believe 12k a month for a BA. You will not get this much unless you work 48 hours a month. Sounds doable, right? Remember all the Chinese festivals during which you have no class? If you‚Äôre not in the classroom, you‚Äôre not getting paid. Say goodbye to a full salary in September (Mid-Autumn festival), October (National Day), April (Qingming), May (May holiday), and June (Dragon Boat Festival). Of course, you get your basic salary during the winter and summer holidays. After tax, that is. And if you get it.  
It‚Äôs perfectly normal for Henan University of Science and Technology to not pay on time. In fact, my friends say that getting paid on time was and still is an exception rather than a rule. The longest they had to wait for salary was almost three months, with two months happening regularly, at least once a year. If you have any loans to pay, do not even consider this school. Your salary will be late, and nobody will feel bad for you.  
Of course, you can report this issue to the administration, but be aware that the administrator will gaslight you. She will tell you that ‚ÄòChinese people save money regularly,‚Äô ‚ÄòYou should have faith in the university,‚Äô and ‚ÄòIf you do not trust the university, maybe you should choose a different country to work in.‚Äô When my friend‚Äôs wife asked the administrator about the salary issue, she was told, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Chinese, and you should support me, not your foreign husband.‚Äù

The second thing is also connected with your earnings: raises and utilities.  
Since 2021, no foreign teacher received a raise. Three contract renewals and nobody got even one RMB more. Also, in 2023, all foreign teachers were informed that from 2024, all of them will have to pay for the utilities, and ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt like it, they can look for a new job.‚Äù If you‚Äôre asking how much the utilities are, your guess is as good as people pay the bills. Nobody knows, and nobody gets a detailed bill. My friends must pay for electricity, water, gas, internet, and heating from October to March. If you think it‚Äôs okay, remember that Luoyang gets snow in winter and over 40C with high humidity in Summer. The AC bill will dig deep into your potential savings.  
Although the university does provide you with the apartment, you are responsible for taking care of all of the utilities, so if anything needs cleaning or fixing (like the AC), you‚Äôll pay for it out of pocket.

Okay, so the salary is terrible, and the cost of utilities is an issue, but maybe the teaching part is organized? No, it‚Äôs not.  
It‚Äôs perfectly normal for students to not have their books until the third or fourth week if they even get a book assigned. You may get a book, which may come around the second or third week. Of course, the curriculum needs to be ready and submitted before you get the book or even the title.  
So maybe if you‚Äôre teaching the same course for the second or third year, you‚Äôll get to keep the same book. Well, yes, but also no. A friend of mine had to write the same course three years because the book was different every year. Another friend had to write a whole course on British and American literature history from scratch because students wouldn‚Äôt get a book. Oh, that course you‚Äôve spent hours and hours preparing? You‚Äôll teach it once a week for two hours, earning approximately 2800 (because some classes will get cancelled).  
Okay, maybe the schedule is set? No. You will get your timetable two days before the first day of class and be happy. Or, you will get it, and then it will be entirely changed in the middle of the term. You‚Äôll need to coordinate four groups with the same course but four separate lessons every week.

Okay, so the salary sucks, the saving potential is limited, and the teaching part is problematic, to say the least, then how about time off? Luoyang is a great place; it is polluted, cold in winter, and hot and humid in summer, but if you like museums, you‚Äôll be fine. You can also go on a trip; remember not to discuss it. Suppose you tell the administrator you‚Äôre leaving for the weekend. In that case, you‚Äôll need to fill in a document, ask your dean for permission, get a lovely red stamp, and submit the document to the administration. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre going to stay overnight at a friend‚Äôs place in Luoyang, going on a one-day trip to another county (and remember, the most popular counties in Luoyang are not accessible to foreigners), visiting friends in another city during a long weekend, or going back home for the summer, the procedure stays the same.

I don‚Äôt know how clear it is by now, so let‚Äôs cut to the underlying problem: communication. Or rather, lack of.  
You will be gaslit. If your salary is late, you will be blamed. A friend of mine didn‚Äôt get his salary. First, he was blamed, then the bank was blamed, and finally, the administrator realized she had sent my friend‚Äôs salary to his old bank account. I heard that getting his money back was a real treat for anyone who likes dealing with Chinese banks in a city where they don‚Äôt speak English, even at the main branch.  
You will be informed about things at the last minute. It‚Äôs a Sunday morning, and do you want to sleep in? Wake up because you must pick up mooncakes and pose for a photo.  
You will not be informed about things at all. They will happen, and you must deal with the consequences.  


Obviously, it‚Äôs not everything. There are issues with travel reimbursement, incorrect taxation, lack of social insurance, lying, and so many other things. Do yourself a favor and do not work for Henan University of Science and Technology.

TLDR: **Do not work for Henan University of Science and Technology**. The advertised salary is a lie, and it is rarely on time. You pay the utilities out of pocket and will never know how much they are. The teaching part is chaotic. Every time you want to leave Luoyang, you must ask permission. You will be blamed for every mistake the administration makes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1g1nh8w/do_not_work_for_henan_university_of_science_and/,self.China,2024-10-12 00:47:43,throwaway784392,2024-10-12

606,Employer attractiveness in China,"Hi everyone.

I've been speaking with several senior leaders at a Chinese tech company that operates internationally, and a topic that frequently comes up is the attractiveness of Chinese multinational companies to local talent. It seems that only a small portion of Chinese talent finds it appealing to work at a non-domestic company, even if it's growing rapidly and successfuly outside of China.

These leaders often cite language proficiency as a major barrier, which is understandable. However, they also frequently mention a ""lack of international mindset"" as a challenge when finding and developing Chinese  talent to work with international markets. At first, I interpreted this as a lack of interest in learning about other markets, but it appears to be more than that.

I know this is a broad question, but in this context, how would you describe this ""lack of an international mindset""?

618,The Double-Edged Sword of Semiconductor Export Controls,"U.S. policymakers are increasingly leveraging export controls on advanced semiconductors and related technologies to constrain China‚Äôs development of military and dual-use capabilities. But notably, expanding U.S. trade restrictions have heightened political and commercial pressure on Chinese semiconductor companies to wean off U.S. technology wherever possible, with potential negative impacts for U.S. technological leadership. This report, the first in a series of four, explains how export controls have accelerated and scaled Chinese efforts to design out (i.e., adopt alternative sources for U.S. technologies) and design around (i.e., innovate new technologies that bypass U.S. technologies altogether), ultimately facilitating a shift of global semiconductor supply chains away from the United States. This report describes how the design-out and design-around strategies jeopardize U.S. economic and national security due to the diversion of sales and innovation to China and other nations‚Äô technology champions. The report then describes Chinese efforts to develop advanced packaging capabilities to ‚Äúleapfrog‚Äù U.S. and allies‚Äô leadership in leading-edge chip design and manufacturing. It is argued that advanced packaging provides a key example of the design-around trend and threatens to shift the balance of U.S.-China competition in critical technologies. The report concludes with emphasizing the importance and challenges of greater multilateralization as well as potential avenues to mitigate the negative impacts of controls on U.S. companies.

So I figured I would ask here, what is everyone's favorite Chinese games? Any that you feel are lesser known about that you really enjoy?

I love the RPGs *Hero's Adventure: Road to Passion* and *Path of Wuxia*.

I have also fallen down the rabbit hole of playing a ton of Chinese FMV games as they have been coming out. There are far too many to name but some of the good ones include: *Love is All Around*, *Director Simulator*, *Charming Hearts*, *My Destiny Girls*, and *Vanity Fair*)

 ‚Äúsometimes the left hand people are more intelligent than average people‚Äù 

this comment was cute but the other teacher comment was a bit rude, he wanted the classmate to start using right hand and when we said that would be imposible because he was already 13 and had all his live using left hand and the teacher just said ‚Äújust practice more with it‚Äù‚Ä¶ at least he just suggested it, didn‚Äôt really made him change lol

As I see it, the USA is just a facade that very rich families use to keep the poor in check throughout the whole world, if you try to disrupt the agenda of billionaires in any place, there is a high chance that money is donated  via bribes to US politicians to shut you down, starting softly with economic sanctions and ending with military invasion.

So the US state is not meant to protect the welfare state of the people, it is very clear on how lazy the government apparatus is to help people afflicted by the current hurricane and how efficient it is to approve money and resources to Israel. America has so much money and yet many of its people suffer.

In Tik Tok you see a lot of propaganda claiming how China red party is the opposite (or at least try to), always investing in better infrastructure and committing on removing people out of poverty. Would you say thats true? I have a cynical Chinese friend and he is rich and he dislikes the CCP, he says they are corrupt and while America is dictated by corporate interests (a elite of few) the only change in China is that China is dictated by the interest of a different few.

683,How is China actually like,"I‚Äôm a Chinese person who was born and mostly raised in America, although I did live a little in China. My question is, as stated in the title, what‚Äôs China actually like. My family, because they‚Äôre all Chinese, only say good things about China, and I grew up (15 now) thinking China is just the average country. Now that I‚Äôm older, I know a lot about other peoples point of view about China, and I‚Äôm doubting whether everything I grew up knowing was true. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love China, more than America, but Chinese people (the ones I know) have their Chinese opinions on China while most of other countries only say bad things. For example, I went to Xinjiang a few months ago, and supposedly there‚Äôs camps for Uyghurs, but I have Uyghur friends and Xinjiang experiences so I know that it‚Äôs not true at all.  



Something‚Äôs I specifically would want to know is:

Taiwan. Currently, I mostly think Taiwan belongs to China, but everyone else disagrees. Do people say Taiwan is a country because they hate China or because of some other reason? I want to make sure I‚Äôm basing my opinion off on logical reasons and not from how I was raised.

Are Chinese people actually THAT rude? Obviously I‚Äôve had a lot of experience from going to China etc. but I haven‚Äôt had an experience where Chinese people were actually rude, compared to the internet, where it seems like everyone ‚Äúknows‚Äù Korean or Japanese is better.

Could the information on platforms like YouTube be genuine? I‚Äôm not talking about social credit blah blah blah because I know it‚Äôs propaganda, but the other things people talk about, especially the government and how people live, could it be real? There‚Äôs a channel called ‚ÄúChina Insider with David Zhang‚Äù and also another called ‚ÄúLei‚Äôs Real Talk‚Äùon YouTube. I hate everything they say, because, clearly, I‚Äôm Chinese, but I‚Äôm scared that what they say is true and I just really don‚Äôt know about China enough.

As well as having to dodge scooters and those weird tuk-tuk things, both of which are bound by no laws or logic, you have the innate joy of having cars drive at full blast around and in front of you on a right-on-red.

Another anxiety I have with the transit is check in. Ive never done long haul before and I've heard it's common for China Eastern Airlines to not have online check in. In that case when transiting do I just go through as normal and check in again without leaving the airport? Or would this mean I need a visa.

Many thanks I'm advance!

723,China is one economic collapse away from having an all country antiparty movement - Post on China_irl,"Below is a translation (provided by ChatGpt) and the original of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_irl/comments/1fvpshj/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E8%B7%9D%E7%A6%BB%E5%85%A8%E6%B0%91%E5%8F%8D%E5%85%9A%E5%8F%AA%E5%B7%AE%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E7%9C%9F%E6%AD%A3%E7%9A%84%E7%BB%8F%E6%B5%8E%E5%B4%A9%E6%BA%83/). Thought that people would be interested in reading this, as it is the kind of stuff that Chinese folks are saying right now about how bad the economy is: 

China is only one true economic collapse away from nationwide opposition to the Party.I know many people think that the country is already in economic collapse, but in reality, for the average person living in China, it feels more like a 'stagnation'‚Äîa temporary inability to make money.

Today, I came across a pro-government comment, and I noticed that the person was saying the economy is bad because of the pandemic, blaming the U.S. for its economic lockdown on China, claiming things will improve in six months to a year, though you could sense some doubt. This person represents the general mindset of many Chinese people‚Äîthey don't really feel like there has been a true economic collapse, just that they're going through a tough time.

In fact, China is already showing signs that are typical of a government facing widespread public criticism‚Äîeconomic decline, a deteriorating social environment, and dissatisfaction coming from various groups.

Even the Chinese government is deliberately employing a 'divide and rule' strategy. In recent years, it‚Äôs become obvious that the government is using trending topics to fuel conflicts between capital and ordinary people, gender conflicts, and international conflicts, all to divert attention away from criticism of itself. A government resorting to a divide-and-rule strategy is already using its last line of defense.

When a government relies on long-term division of the populace, only two outcomes are likely‚Äîeither fragmentation or rebellion.

As things stand now, rebellion seems to be a far more likely outcome than fragmentation in China. First, the ethnic makeup is relatively homogeneous with no religious conflicts, and second, the economic downturn creates a situation where people are more likely to direct their anger uniformly at the government. Once the demands of different groups 'converge,' the government will inevitably become the target.

Simply put, according to historical patterns, the prerequisite for a government to face widespread opposition is the 'convergence of demands.' And the prerequisite for the 'convergence of demands' is that 'various groups make demands.' We are already at the stage where various groups are making demands. What‚Äôs needed next is further economic deterioration that erodes people's patience, and a sudden event that shatters any remaining hope.""

I completely understand that this is not the easiest diet for China, and I've seen the majority of people saying that it's very difficult to find anything meat free. Is this true? I'm happy to eat with little variety, and I'm not insanely fussy about things made with animal products (broth etc.), even though I avoid them at home in Australia.

Is this pretty common in China and Chinese culture? Any (English) sources out there that go into detail about the cultural origin of this MC style? What significance is there behind two hosts speaking in unison? Are there classes or training people go through in order to be an official MC for a large event? Where can I go online to learn more?

In all the events I've attended in USA, I can't think of one when there were two hosts.

Then my next question (similar), I still have to book a return ticket from Bali to Amsterdam in November. My best option seems to be with Xiamen Air. However that's a total traveling time of 24 hours (6 hour layover in Xiamen). 

So I had the idea to first fly from Bali to Xiamen on a monday and stay 2 days in Xiamen. Then fly Xiamen to Amsterdam on wednesday. 

My question; is this possible since I will have 2 different China entries in a time of ~3 weeks. Again, I'm Dutch (should be able to visit China without a visa as long as it's less than 15 days and have a return ticket.

792,Friend got detained in China. Help.,"My friend is from an Eastern European country and came to a small city near Beijing to teach English at a small training center. His employer promised him a work visa but instead only gave him a business visa. They assured him that he would be fine because ""no one cares."" However, he dated a Chinese girl who later broke up with him and demanded money, threatening to report him to immigration if he didn‚Äôt give her the money. He didn‚Äôt believe she would follow through and didn't have the money anyway, and blocked her on WeChat.

Yesterday, we went out together to the city center. There were many police officers checking IDs at a subway station. At first, we thought they wouldn‚Äôt check us because we are foreigners, but they rudely stopped us, demanding our passports or personal information. We showed them our passports, and they scanned them using a phone app. My friend's passport flagged red on the officer's phone, and they immediately called in colleagues and security guards to surround us. They took us to a private room near the security checkpoint.

They asked us to hand over our phones and belongings and wait. They questioned us about what we do in China, how we met, and for our employers' phone numbers and addresses, etc. I told the truth but my friend pretend to be a business visitor, but of course they knew everything already... Twenty minutes later, they released me and gave me back my phone and passport and belongings because I have a work residence permit but my friend was taken away by the police. They told me he has been arrested for working illegally.

So far, I haven‚Äôt been able to reach him. His phone was taken by the police, I assume, and it‚Äôs unclear what will happen to him next. I know he is not rich and may not have much money to pay the heavy fine or buy a last minute ticket home during this peak season. Does anyone have any idea what might happen to him?

795,"I just returned from my first trip to China since before the pandemic, and wrote about my observations in a short essay. Would love to get feedback on the content and my writing.","Prior to my first study abroad trip to China in 2007, the professor I held in highest regard shared a parable for how China is often misunderstood by outsiders.¬†*When a traveller stays in China for a week they feel as though they can write an entire book about the place; if they stay for months, a person feels only comfortable enough to share an essay; and after years in China, one can hardly say anything at all.*¬†It was, of course, a plea for humility on the upcoming journey. I always loved this framing, and have ever since been cautious to listen too much to those who have spent short amounts of time in China but have much to say about it. Having previously spent years in China, but now just returning from a 10 day trip, I feel a short essay on my observations and experiences is within the bounds of reason.

The below is presented in a way not intended to cast judgement or compare status with the US, but rather to better understand the current state of China as it has changed or remained the same in relation to my previous visits (8 months in Shenzhen working for Intel Corp in 2018) as well as those prior (various study and work stints from 2007-2019).

**A Summary of Main Takeaways:**  
  
**1. Cracks in the Chinese Dream ‚Äî The average person‚Äôs confidence in the economy and future is increasingly bleak:**  
Throughout the trip I asked people how they felt about the economy and their own personal situation. Not one person was positive, which was expected considering nearly all but the older generation has never experienced growth rates as slow as today‚Äôs. The more concerning part for me was the creeping attitude of helplessness that accompanied the economic malaise. Many people no longer feel in control of their own destiny, which is a stark departure from the recent past. Perhaps a taxi driver in Shanghai summarized it best, ‚ÄúEven if I work harder, I can‚Äôt make more money. There is just no more money to make.‚Äù

In 2017 I was waiting in a long line to enter the British Museum in London, which among many far more interesting exhibits also had a¬†[new offering](https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/american-dream-pop-present)¬†about the history of the American Dream. I was standing near some Chinese tourists, who were speaking amongst themselves in Mandarin. As any language learner does, I was eavesdropping on their conversation to see how much I could follow. One woman when she saw the sign for the American Dream exhibit loudly exclaimed in surprise ‚ÄúOh wow, Americans also have an American Dream.‚Äù If a government weaves the idea of an American or¬†[Chinese Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Dream)¬†into the fabric of its culture, it becomes a liability to the government in power when this dream is no longer achievable.

**2. China is stuck in the past to its own detriment (even more so than previously):**  
The Chinese government continues to fan the flames of anti-foreign sentiment through its messaging and control of media narratives, particularly anti-Japanese and anti-American. While I was in China, a 10 year old Japanese boy was¬†[stabbed to death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyeyP8Qjdko)¬†in Shenzhen, following another targeting a bus full of Japanese children¬†[being attempted](https://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/chinese-woman-tried-shield-japanese-084639503.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHTd70hiXfzpikIiC0hrcGmZ7n2GoqLTEmKiTE-Pn53d54jS95K7Dx250X4svNRkpaWG5z7Eo2B0ZGz1WV-xyI45NM4S2fLnN5JZfb9haNx2kzzEyuvD63_0bxo1FHOp_ngk9rBlWdRc8rtoEDtfm_qby1cYBIre7Fh0i5svy_vt). After a late night¬†[baijiu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baijiu)-fueled discussion with my father-in-law about how the US approach to the aftermath of World War 2 (e.g. Marshall Plan and rebuilding of Japan) was strategically motivated rather than grievance motivated, the following morning I was woken by an intensely loud siren that blared for 30 minutes. It turned out this siren was to remind people of the Japanese invasion that occurred in the 1930s ‚Äî nearly 100 years ago.

During my years in China there have only been a handful of occasions where I was targeted as a foreigner (only verbally, not physically). Never did I feel unsafe, and I believe the majority of Chinese people are friendly and welcoming to foreigners. Yet the Chinese government‚Äôs tactics which rile up hatred for foreigners has cultivated a powerful online nationalist/misogynist following that¬†[bullies anyone](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051231170816)¬†who goes against the narrative. In a hyper-online country this filters into society and preys on the most vulnerable, who take their grievances and put them into action. Strategically, China needs foreign talent, ideas, and investment, yet the more it stirs resentment, the less of these foreign assets it receives. The obvious answer to why the Chinese government is engaging in this direction is that it is a useful tool for maintaining control over their domestic populace, yet my view is that the¬†[CCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party)¬†is firmly in control so such actions are self-defeating. The only reason to be pushing this pedal harder now is that they are¬†[preparing for more difficult times ahead](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3011186/xi-jinping-calls-new-long-march-dramatic-sign-china-preparing), which will test their grip on power ‚Äî whether that be further economic hardship or war.  
  
**3. Chinese EVs are everywhere, but so are Teslas. EV scooters are hugely impactful:**  
It was no surprise to see Chinese domestic EV brand cars on every road in China, yet I was impressed by the amount of Teslas ‚Äî just as if not more ubiquitous than in the US. It was also striking to see so many retail stores and the 1st floor of so many malls be taken over by car dealers (as opposed to luxury brands in the recent past). The amount of capital being spent by these car companies, and the sheer amount of them, dictates that many will soon go bankrupt. As my wife and I remarked about the car brands we saw in various malls, there were always several we had never heard of or seen before. I imagine most are losing money.

Last time I was in China there were e-bikes everywhere (actual bicycles powered by batteries), which resulted in a huge oversupply and massive¬†[e-bike graveyards](https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2018/03/bike-share-oversupply-in-china-huge-piles-of-abandoned-and-broken-bicycles/556268/). This time I saw very few e-bikes, but electric powered scooters were everywhere (especially once we left Shanghai). The business model for e-scooters is completely different from e-bikes in that e-bikes were owned by the companies and rented through QR code scanned micro-transactions, whereas the e-scooters are personal property that is paid for and stored by individuals. The spread of e-scooters as a primary mode of transportation for so many (the majority of Chinese people outside of Tier 1 cities cannot afford or do not have space for a car), will have major effects. For example, I heard from a friend who contracts with government infrastructure providers that the subway is barely breaking even and many infrastructure projects have begun to lose money. This is the result of people pinching pennies in a down economy, but also they have a mode of transportation that is cheaper and often times more convenient than public transport, even for longer distances. I saw multiple public works projects that seemed as though they had been started but put on hold.  
  
**4. Far less construction, but still more than expected:**  
The national bird of China is the¬†[red-crowned crane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-crowned_crane), but for most of my previous years in China it was jokingly referred to as the (construction) crane. With the housing market in trouble, I expected to observe very little construction during this trip. To my surprise there was still a fair amount of it, especially in Shanghai. The construction taking place appeared to be of all kinds - residential, commercial, and infrastructure. There did seem to be significantly less construction once we left Shanghai and spent time travelling through tier 2-3 cities.  
  
The biggest driver of the Chinese economy is¬†[real estate](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/feeling-poorer-property-slump-hurting-chinese-consumers-clouds-recovery-2023-04-14/), where 70% of household wealth is stored. For most Chinese who have excess savings, the first investment vehicle they aspire to purchase is an additional apartment to rent out and generate income on. So when the housing market is in such a slump as it is now (both lower market values and rents), nearly everyone feels poorer. It‚Äôs hard to overstate just how much everyone‚Äôs savings is tied up in real estate ‚Äî even poorer people will try to buy a small apartment in an undesirable area before they think about almost any other investment option. The result of this phenomenon is that high-rise builders thought there would be no end to the amount of apartments they could build. They took on huge debts to continue fueling endless building. As housing supply far exceeded demand, the economically inept leader of China stated that ‚Äú[houses are for living, not for speculation.](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-should-stick-houses-are-living-not-speculation-state-media-2023-08-23/)‚Äù This spooked the markets, as whenever he speaks out about a certain industry, that¬†[industry](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-impose-hefty-fines-penalties-illegal-education-tutors-2023-09-13/)¬†([or person](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/16/alibaba-founder-jack-ma-is-alive-and-happy-after-china-crackdown.html)) ends up being destroyed. Coupled with debts that began to go bad for many construction companies, the housing market is in a real pickle.  
  
**5. Western culture and US soft power is still prevalent:**  
As Comrade Xi has spent¬†[much of his focus](https://english.www.gov.cn/news/202409/29/content_WS66f95efec6d0868f4e8eb667.html)¬†promoting the Communist Party‚Äôs version of his country‚Äôs 5,000 years of history and culture, I expected to see far less foreign brands visible on street and person. There did seem to be less shops headlined by foreign brands, but the amount of clothing worn with American brands and American sports teams was just as omnipresent as during my previous trips. This was especially true of American Major League Baseball ([MLB](https://www.mlb.com/)) hats ‚Äî for some reason this must be a new stylistic trend, especially for California teams like the Los Angeles Dodgers. Likely the result of so many Chinese having relatives in the Golden State.

In addition, I saw more visible tattoos (something I hardly ever saw 15-20 years ago in China). It did seem like the amount of dogs (considered by the CCP as a western bourgeois luxury) was about the same.

**A Few Minor Observations:**

* Overall far fewer foreigners, yet the proportion of Africans has increased.
* There are a lot more fat people in China than 5 years ago, particularly among young people.
* Shanghai felt darker than I remember (lights are off earlier at night in many buildings).
* Retail shops are struggling. Many closed shops observed walking along the roads.
* Visibly ageing society ‚Äî the amount and proportion of old people is higher than 5 years ago.
* Bullet trains and public transport are incredibly clean, well run, and convenient. The amount of lines available now, even to smaller cities, is truly astounding.
* Not a single app I normally check on my phone worked in China (the effectiveness and reach of the Great Firewall seems to have increased).

**Final Thoughts:**  
The reason I have spent so much of my adult life in China is because I love the country; its history, people, and language. This essay may seem overly negative and judgemental to China‚Äôs current state, yet it is my honest observation on what has changed from my previous time there. I feel incredibly lucky to have first visited in 2007 and subsequently experienced the following decade of rapid economic expansion and openness. Unfortunately a reversal of this positive trend has accelerated.

Over the past week China has begun to stimulate the economy by lowering mortgage rates and taking measures to boost consumer spending. I thought this would happen much earlier in the year, but for whatever reason the Party leadership has decided now is the time (likely they realize 2024 growth targets will not be met if they do nothing). David Tepper, a famous hedge fund manager, went on CNBC and said to ‚Äú[buy everything Chinese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGeyiFj-7D4),‚Äù and thereafter Chinese stocks went up 20-40% over the week. I think it‚Äôs an incredibly dangerous game to play by buying Chinese stocks now, because the hedge funds are only in temporarily, and will sell before you as an individual investor are aware it‚Äôs happening. Then, because the stimulus measures are not addressing the structural problems in China, Chinese stocks will drop precipitously at the first sign of bad news or one of the hedge funds selling.

804,My Chinese boss is overwhelming me and I'm afraid he is a threat to my job. ,"I hope I'm not being disrespectful, but I need to vent here. I work in a large Chinese energy company in Brazil, and I recently started assisting my boss as a shareholder representative and it has been a big culture shock. He is clueless about everything all the time, and it not only drives me insane but also negatively impacts my daily productivity and performance.

He asks for help with the simplest daily administrative tasks such as approving payments, signing contracts, and understanding bylaws, because he simply doesn't try, unlike other Chinese superiors I‚Äôve seen. I‚Äôve often had to teach my boss things I barely knew myself, without any support. I've presented topics in shareholder meetings where he didn't say a word to back me up. I'm basically the boss of my boss and it feels like he doesn't want to be exposed or vulnerable so he makes us Brazilians take on his responsibilities to maintain a clean image.

I took the place of someone who was fired by him simply because he didn't like him (and I'm just cheaper). This is very intimidating because I am junior and he was senior, he had a background in finance and I don't, which is important for this role. I‚Äôm starting to learn how to handle him better by being less reactive, simplifying every information I share, avoiding confrontation, etc. However, there are days when my patience runs out and I go into fight or flight, mainly because he calls me to his office multiple times a day and I have to walk across the entire building floor for ridiculous matters that could be solved with a message. People are even starting to joke about it, they call me the marathon runner lol.

Today, for example, literally as soon as I arrived at the office my phone rang and I chose to ignore it. I am now working in a small meeting room instead.

I've talked to other superiors about this situation, trying not to throw my boss under the bus obviously, but there's nothing that can be done since he‚Äôs in his position due to politics rather than skills or knowledge, so I don't expect him to leave anytime soon. But it has been overwhelming to feel constantly afraid of losing the opportunity of growing here because if I mess up, he will just fire me like he did to the last guy.

812,Does it make sense for me to being proud of being Chinese but not proud about the country?,"**repost**

My Chinese social media is now full of post about people being proud of their country in this independence week

I don‚Äôt feel proud of my country, I don‚Äôt like some of it politics, and also don‚Äôt like some of their people behaviors and thinking

But I also practice chinese martial arts and by default learned a lot of Chinese history and traditions, I really like how Chinese show respect and many Chinese traditional behaviors, thanks to the martial art I practice I got to know and learn about China from another perspective and with this way I can say I do feel proud of being Chinese 

The way Chinese shows respect to their guest or any random guy that has interaction, the respect that they show to their family, all that comes from tradition and not the actual country, but the way schools wants to teach children to love their country more than their own family do comes from the country and how they want my province (canton) to forget Cantonese and speak only mandarin

So, in proud of being Chinese but not proud of my country.. 

‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫sounds cool and I feel proud when I say I am but ‰∏≠Âçé‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩ doesn‚Äôt make me feel anything

The censorship is unsurprising since he is basically saying local governments are kidnapping people and forcing them to pay ransom, because they are so desperate for revenue. Zhou writes ‚ÄúRecently, local governments at all levels are facing widespread financial difficulties, and local party committees have assigned tasks to supplement local fiscal revenue to various party, government, and judicial institutions. The pressure of balancing income and expenditure and repaying debts is understandable. However, if local disciplinary inspection committees at all levels detain entrepreneurs who have allegedly bribed, are suspected of bribery, or even those who have been reported based on rumors, and then release them for money to obtain local fiscal revenue, it will certainly lead to another national economic disaster if it spreads.‚Äù]",https://sinocism.com/p/more-special-bonds-for-fiscal-stimulus?open=false#%C2%A7call-for-local-governments-to-stop-raising-money-by-detaining-private-entrepreneurs,sinocism.com,2024-09-30 15:37:13,ADRIANBABAYAGAZENZ,2024-09-30

These posts are made by publicist accounts and claim quite confidently and fervently that Frederic ‚Äúonly then‚Äù decided to go after Lisa. 

Honestly I‚Äôm not even a Lisa fan at all but do find her to be a hardworking lady. Eileen Gu on the other hand seems to be quite two faced and if she is indeed behind these rumours, well, that‚Äôs a disgusting, almost ÊñáÈù©Êó∂Êúü tactic. 

I wonder if the truth is rather Eileen was dying to win Frederic over (honestly she acts like a Wendi Deng reincarnate) and failed, so she created this fake story to make herself feel better while simultaneously punching Lisa down and elevating herself.

Either way, sometimes as a Chinese person I‚Äôm ashamed of how some Chinese people can manage to be this self aggrandizing, self centered, and self righteous. Take this as a piece of sober cultural reflection more than an attack on this fame seeking and clearly white worshipping and social climbing Eileen Gu.

* Canada goose coats - they don't live in a great part of town (according to my mom) so I'm worried the logo might attract muggers? Any idea if this is a valid concern? They live in Beijing.

899,Is Lowering Interest Rates the Key Factor for Economic Recovery?,"Is Lowering Interest Rates the Key Factor for Economic Recovery?

The post-pandemic recovery presents a valuable opportunity for economic revival. During the pandemic, various subsidies helped maintain purchasing power for both individuals and companies. However, the current trend of decoupling from China could severely impact global supply chains, which remain heavily dependent on Chinese manufacturing. While transitioning supply chains is possible, doing so too aggressively during a period of economic recovery‚Äîwhen the world still relies on China‚Äîrisks exacerbating inflationary pressures.

Despite any concerns about China‚Äôs political system, the fact remains that the world depends on its comprehensive supply chain. This reliance might seem less than ideal, but it‚Äôs a reality. The decoupling policies that are being implemented not only harm China but also create significant challenges for other economies, potentially leading to shortages and longer delivery times for key products.

Some claim that China has excess production capacity, but this argument overlooks the reality that the pandemic only pressed the pause button on the economy, not on demand. Now that global demand is picking up again, supply chain disruptions are further straining economies, with delivery times for many orders extending up to a year.

Though central banks are lowering interest rates to stimulate economic activity, this approach doesn‚Äôt address the underlying supply chain issues. The global economy can‚Äôt easily or quickly replace the foundational support provided by China‚Äôs existing production network. Tackling inflation by simply stimulating demand without addressing supply chain disruptions is akin to treating the symptoms rather than the cause.

Moreover, the impact of inflation is often misunderstood. Many people fail to grasp the true consequences of inflation on their wealth. While their bank balances might not change, the value of that money is steadily eroded. For example, what once cost $100 might now require $130, meaning that even though the nominal value remains the same, its purchasing power has decreased significantly. This kind of ‚Äúhidden shrinkage‚Äù in wealth is just as real as visible losses in stock markets, yet it‚Äôs often overlooked.

It‚Äôs concerning that many individuals seem unaware of this erosion of purchasing power. Some even argue that their money hasn‚Äôt decreased in quantity, misunderstanding that inflation is quietly reducing the real value of their assets. While stock market prices fluctuate and are immediately visible, the slow burn of inflation is often harder to see, but it has an equally damaging effect over time.

Historically, economic missteps, such as those during the 1930s Great Depression, were often caused by a lack of timely government intervention. Although governments today are taking action, there is a risk that some of these policies are too aggressive and optimistic. We must be cautious of the long-term costs associated with such policies, as rushing through decoupling or overestimating the speed at which new supply chains can be established could lead to further economic distress.

While some may argue that my concerns are exaggerated, I believe many experts have likely raised similar warnings. Economic policy mistakes can have far-reaching consequences, and it‚Äôs often the middle class and below who bear the brunt of these costs. My hope is that the current approach will not result in irreversible damage to both global supply chains and the broader economy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1frleqk/is_lowering_interest_rates_the_key_factor_for/,self.China,2024-09-28 19:57:39,Sufficient_Reason968,2024-09-28
