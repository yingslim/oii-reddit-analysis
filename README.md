## Research plan: 
**Unit of Analysis**: <br/>
Subreddits: r/China, r/Taiwan, r/HongKong<br/>
**Object of Interest**:

2. Width of information creation from celebrities’ activity -> number of interlinked internal/external information sources

**Operationalisation**:
1. Fetch edit histories of page Taylor Swift and Kanye West
2. Time series analysis to see how the edit amounts corresponds to their conflicts
3. Compare if there’s significant differences on edits / contradictory edits (wiping facts and write in contradictory arguments) between the two

   - Collective information creation reflected through the proliferated interlinks?
4. Editor analysis, common editors updating both public figures' pages
