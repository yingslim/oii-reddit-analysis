# Reddit Data Analysis 
This is a group project for OII's social data science class. <br/>

## Research question: 
What is the Western perception of Chinese cultural identity and political influence across mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong? <br/>
- Hypothesis: On Reddit, Western perceptions of China are more focused on political topics, while discussions surrounding Taiwan and Hong Kong are often centered around tourism and culture rather than politics. 

## Research plan: 
**Unit of Analysis**: <br/>
Subreddits: r/China, r/Taiwan, r/HongKong<br/>

**Object of Interest**: 
1. Understand how political and cultural topics are discussed in these subreddits. This would involve categorizing posts based on whether they are primarily about political issues (e.g., government policies, international relations) or cultural matters (e.g., traditions, language, art, tourism).
2. The engagement patterns and behavior of users in relation to political and cultural posts.

**Operationalisation**:
1. Fetch subreddit posts from r/China, r/Taiwan, r/HongKong
2. Displaying term frequencies over time and mapping subreddit similarity.
3. Identifying the in-community engagement patterns.
